However, only a subset of component tests may be performed on your specimen. You should verify accuracy of codes listed. When multiple codes are listed, select codes for the tests actually performed on your specimen.

Approximately 10 million clinical laboratory test results per year are performed in these laboratories. Specimen Handling Containers Specimens are acceptable for processing only when collected and submitted in the appropriate container. Shipping containers, sterile specimen containers, transport media and swabs are available through Client Services. Specimen containers must be tightened securely to prevent leakage. Labeling Clearly print the patient’s complete name (as listed on the test request form) on the specimen container, culturette, or other specimen transport media. (Labeling of only the outside container is not acceptable). Transport Deliver specimens to the laboratory within 24 hours. Prompt processing minimizes loss in viability of potential pathogens and ensures a more accurate appraisal of flora present. Specimen Rejection Criteria for Microbiology Specimens Client Services will notify the ordering facility or healthcare provider of any test cancellations. Common causes for rejection of microbiology specimens are: Inappropriate specimen for culture requested Improper specimen container or transport media Inappropriate specimen for culture requested Improper specimen container or transport media Forms Collection Guidelines: Clean Catch List of Allergens Authorization for Test Add Request Collection Guidelines: Clean Catch List of Allergens Authorization for Test Add Request General Microbiology Culture Types and Collection Instructions Blood Bacterial Urine Respiratory Stool Misc Blood Bacterial Urine Respiratory Stool Misc The detection of microorganisms in blood has great diagnostic and prognostic importance. A completed test request form (particularly time of collection, diagnosis and antimicrobial therapy) is essential for timely and appropriate laboratory processing of the specimen. All routine blood cultures are screened for aerobic and anaerobic bacterial and fungal isolates. All organisms isolated from blood cultures will be identified, susceptibility tests performed, if appropriate, and stock cultures made, unless the isolate is considered a skin contaminant. Stock cultures will be held for 30 days. Organisms that may be contaminants are coagulase negative Staphylococcus species, Bacillus species, diphtheroid bacilli and viridans Streptococcus species. Blood cultures from patients suspected of having Brucella must be specifically requested as special cultures. (See the individual culture listings of the specific organisms for further details). Guidelines for Drawing Cultures In most adult infections, cultures of two to three separate venipunctures (20-30 mL per venipuncture) are sufficient. Studies have shown the following positive blood culture yields within a 24-hour period in patients without endocarditis: First venipuncture (Set): 80% First and second venipunctures (Set): 90% First, second and third venipunctures (Set): 99% Based on these results, the laboratory will not accept more than four blood culture sets per 24 hours per patient. In suspected acute sepsis, meningitis, osteomyelitis, arthritis or acute untreated bacterial pneumonia, obtain two blood culture sets (from two separate venipuncture sites) before starting therapy. For suspected infective endocarditis. Acute: Obtain three blood culture sets with three separate venipunctures during the first one to two hours of evaluation. Subacute: Obtain three blood culture sets on Day 1 (15 minutes or more apart). If all three are negative at 24 hours, obtain three more. A direct correlation exists between the volume of blood cultured and the recovery rate of clinically significant organisms. For adult patients, each blood culture bottle should receive 10mL of blood. Isolators should receive 10mL as indicated on the tube. For pediatric patients, one to five mL of blood injected into one aerobic blood culture bottle is sufficient. Specimen Collection After placing a tourniquet on the patient's arm, select a suitable vein. Once the vein has been found, cleanse the area with the series of 2% iodine, 70% alcohol, iodine and alcohol. Without touching the site of the venipuncture with the fingers, draw 20mL of blood into a sterile syringe. Inject 10mL of the specimen into each of two culture bottles after cleansing the stoppers with 2% iodine. Invert the containers several times to insure thorough mixture of the contents. (Blood culture systems are available through Client Services). For pediatric patients, write the volume of blood inoculated on the label. Blood cultures from patients suspected of having Histoplasma capsulatum, Brucella, Bartonella, Legionella or Mycobacterium must be specifically requested as special cultures and must be collected in a lysis-centrifugation (Isolator™) tube. (See the individual culture listings of the specific organisms for further details.) Complete a Test Request Form indicating the specific source of the specimen, diagnosis and organism(s) suspected. Label the specimen appropriately. Record the date and time the specimen was collected. Submit specimens in urine culture transport tubes provided by Cleveland Clinic Laboratories. Indicate whether the specimen is from a clean catch or a catheter. Indwelling Catheter Specimen Collection Obtain the specimen with a needle and syringe. Select the puncture site 1-2 inches away from the catheter tube entry point. Cleanse the area to be punctured with 70% alcohol. Aspirate exactly 5mL of urine with a sterile needle and syringe. Disinfect the rubber stopper and aseptically transfer the specimen to the urine transport tube provided. Specimens obtained from the collection bag are not suitable for analysis. Foley tips will not be accepted. Urine Culture Transport Prevention of contamination by normal vaginal, perineal, and anterior urethral flora is the most important consideration for collection of a clinically relevant urine specimen. (See the Patient Collection Guidelines above for collection of a urine specimen). Unpreserved urine is an excellent growth medium for most bacteria. Unless urine is preserved during transport, bacteria may multiply, causing colony counts to be erroneously high. The maintenance medium in the transport kit prevents rapid multiplication of bacteria in the urine during shipment. Instructions for use of urine culture transport system: Obtain the urine specimen from the patient in a clean cup. Open the pouch and remove the transfer device and tube. Submerge the pipette of the transfer device to the bottom of the urine container. The container may be tipped at an angle if the volume of the urine is limited. Place the transport tube in the holder portion of the transfer device and push it down as far as it will go, puncturing the stopper. Hold the tube and transfer device in position until the urine stops flowing into the tube. Remove the transport tube from the transfer device and shake the tube vigorously. Discard the transfer device and remaining cup of urine into appropriate biohazard disposal containers. Precaution: The transport tube must be filled to the minimum line indicated on the tube. A tube that is not filled at least to this line is unacceptable for culture. The following collection sites are considered respiratory specimens: mouth, nose, nasopharyngeal swabs, throat sputum, bronchial and tracheal aspirations, bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and Bartlett Fiberoptic Wimberly (BFW) brush. All specimens from these sites will be screened for fast-growing aerobic pathogenic organisms and for Beta Strep Group A. The following organisms are examples of those not isolated by routine culture: Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Corynebacterium diphtheriae and Bordetella species. Specimens from the nose are the only respiratory specimens routinely screened for Haemophilus species. For information on culture of non-routine organisms, see the culture listing for the specific organism. Refer to the Test Directory for collection information. Specimens must be submitted in transport media provided by the laboratory. Specimens from normally sterile sites (such as body fluids, surgical specimens, joint fluids, etc.) will be cultured for aerobic pathogenic organisms. Anaerobic pathogens may be detected by routine cultures. However, be aware of the special requirements for the isolation of anaerobes. If an anaerobic organism is suspected, a specimen should be submitted for anaerobic culture. Bone marrow, eye swabs, joint fluids and cerebrospinal fluids are routinely screened for fast-growing aerobic pathogenic bacteria including Haemophilus species and pathogenic Neisseria species. Body fluids (exclusive of joint or cerebrospinal fluids) and surgical specimens will be routinely screened for fast-growing aerobic pathogens. Genital tract specimens are tested for Neisseria gonorrhoeae and/or Chlamydia trachomatis by amplification. If Haemophilus ducreyi is suspected, a special request must be made. In cases of suspected toxic shock syndrome, the tentative diagnosis should be placed on the requisition form so that isolates of Staphylococcus aureus may be saved for TSST-1 testing. Vaginal specimens must be accompanied by a request for examination for a specific organism (i.e. group B streptococci, Candida, Trichomonias vaginalis) or for gram stain, which may be examined for the presence of clue cells, curved bacteria, relative proportion of gram-positive bacilli resembling lactobacilli vs. Gram-negative bacilli. Culture for Gardnerella vaginalis is neither sensitive nor specific for the diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis and will not be done. Specimens from wounds, ulcers, and drainages will be screened for nonfastidious, fast-growing aerobic organisms. If an anaerobe is suspected, a specimen must be properly submitted and an anaerobic culture specifically ordered. Nose or Nasopharyngeal Swabs Collect in a manner to avoid contamination by adjacent structures. Throat Specimens Collect in a manner to avoid contamination by mouth and tongue. Throat specimens will be screened for Group A Strep only. Throat specimens for Neisseria ganorrohoeae, Bordetella pertussis or Corynebacterium diphtheriae will be screened only for that pathogen when specifically requested. Collect in a manner to avoid contamination by mouth and tongue. Sputum Specimens Collect by instructing the patient to remove dentures, rinse mouth, gargle with water and cough deeply, expectorating into appropriate collection container. All specimens labeled \"sputum\" that are consistent on cytologic examination with saliva or upper respiratory secretions will be rejected. Rejection or acceptance will be based on microscopic examination for the absence of/or minimal numbers of squamous epithelial cells. Tracheal and Bronchial Aspiration Collect by physician to avoid contamination with adjacent structures. Fungus Provide complete information on the Test Request Form to ensure that the specimen is cultured for all organisms (fungi/yeast) suspected. Additional patient history may be helpful. Include the patient occupation, history of travel or residence abroad, and any animal contacts. A single specimen may be cultured for both bacteria and fungi. Generally, a direct fungal smear exam will be performed on all specimens submitted for fungal cultures. Yeast Requirements are the same as for a fungal culture. Urine, vaginal, throat and stool requests are routinely processed for a yeast culture, even if ordered as a fungal culture. Anaerobes Cultures for fastidious anaerobes will not be performed on urine (nonsuprapubic aspirate) or specimens from body sites that have anaerobes as part of the normal flora (stool, skin, vagina/cervix, mouth, throat, septum, etc.). Any material collected from areas with no normal flora (body fluids, deep abscess exudate, tissue biopsies, transtracheal aspirates, etc.) is acceptable for anaerobic culture. Specimens for anaerobic culture must be collected appropriately and transported in an anaerobic environment (anaerobe vial). Aspirated specimens, in general, are preferred. Swabs are unacceptable for anaerobe culture. Contact Client Services prior to collection of the specimen for consultation on collection procedures, containers, or transport. Acid-Fast Bacillus All cultures and stains for AFB are performed at Cleveland Clinic. Acid-fast stain results are generally available 24-48 hours from receipt of sample. Positive stains and/or culture results are called to the client. Transport specimens in sterile, leak-proof containers and place in appropriate shipping containers. Dry specimens or spilled-leaking specimens are not acceptable for AFB culture. Specimens submitted on swabs or sputums of low volume are discouraged for AFB culture because the yield is significantly decreased. Gastric contents must be neutralized with sodium carbonate or another alkaline buffer salt before transport. Respiratory specimens may be submitted for Mycobacterium tuberculosis amplification. Only specimens that are AFB stain positive are appropriate for testing. An AFB culture and smear should be ordered in conjunction with this request. This test is specific for, but does not differentiate between, members of the M. tuberculosis complex, i.e. M. tuberculosis, M. bovis BCG, M. africanum and M. micrati. A negative test does not exclude the possibility of isolating M. tuberculosis complex from the AFB culture. The detection of microorganisms in blood has great diagnostic and prognostic importance. A completed test request form (particularly time of collection, diagnosis and antimicrobial therapy) is essential for timely and appropriate laboratory processing of the specimen. All routine blood cultures are screened for aerobic and anaerobic bacterial and fungal isolates. All organisms isolated from blood cultures will be identified, susceptibility tests performed, if appropriate, and stock cultures made, unless the isolate is considered a skin contaminant.

Genital tract specimens are tested for Neisseria gonorrhoeae and/or Chlamydia trachomatis by amplification. If Haemophilus ducreyi is suspected, a special request must be made. In cases of suspected toxic shock syndrome, the tentative diagnosis should be placed on the requisition form so that isolates of Staphylococcus aureus may be saved for TSST-1 testing. Vaginal specimens must be accompanied by a request for examination for a specific organism (i.e. group B streptococci, Candida, Trichomonias vaginalis) or for gram stain, which may be examined for the presence of clue cells, curved bacteria, relative proportion of gram-positive bacilli resembling lactobacilli vs. Gram-negative bacilli. Culture for Gardnerella vaginalis is neither sensitive nor specific for the diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis and will not be done. Specimens from wounds, ulcers, and drainages will be screened for nonfastidious, fast-growing aerobic organisms. If an anaerobe is suspected, a specimen must be properly submitted and an anaerobic culture specifically ordered. Specimens from normally sterile sites (such as body fluids, surgical specimens, joint fluids, etc.) will be cultured for aerobic pathogenic organisms.

Nose or Nasopharyngeal Swabs Collect in a manner to avoid contamination by adjacent structures. Throat Specimens Collect in a manner to avoid contamination by mouth and tongue. Throat specimens will be screened for Group A Strep only. Throat specimens for Neisseria ganorrohoeae, Bordetella pertussis or Corynebacterium diphtheriae will be screened only for that pathogen when specifically requested. Collect in a manner to avoid contamination by mouth and tongue. Sputum Specimens Collect by instructing the patient to remove dentures, rinse mouth, gargle with water and cough deeply, expectorating into appropriate collection container. All specimens labeled \"sputum\" that are consistent on cytologic examination with saliva or upper respiratory secretions will be rejected. Rejection or acceptance will be based on microscopic examination for the absence of/or minimal numbers of squamous epithelial cells. Tracheal and Bronchial Aspiration Collect by physician to avoid contamination with adjacent structures. Fungus Provide complete information on the Test Request Form to ensure that the specimen is cultured for all organisms (fungi/yeast) suspected. Additional patient history may be helpful. Include the patient occupation, history of travel or residence abroad, and any animal contacts. A single specimen may be cultured for both bacteria and fungi. Generally, a direct fungal smear exam will be performed on all specimens submitted for fungal cultures. Yeast Requirements are the same as for a fungal culture. Urine, vaginal, throat and stool requests are routinely processed for a yeast culture, even if ordered as a fungal culture. Anaerobes Cultures for fastidious anaerobes will not be performed on urine (nonsuprapubic aspirate) or specimens from body sites that have anaerobes as part of the normal flora (stool, skin, vagina/cervix, mouth, throat, septum, etc.). Any material collected from areas with no normal flora (body fluids, deep abscess exudate, tissue biopsies, transtracheal aspirates, etc.) is acceptable for anaerobic culture. Specimens for anaerobic culture must be collected appropriately and transported in an anaerobic environment (anaerobe vial). Aspirated specimens, in general, are preferred. Swabs are unacceptable for anaerobe culture. Contact Client Services prior to collection of the specimen for consultation on collection procedures, containers, or transport. Acid Fast Bacillus All cultures and stains for AFB are performed at Cleveland Clinic. Acid fast stain results are generally available 24-48 hours from receipt of sample. Positive stains and/or culture results are called to the client. Transport specimens in sterile, leak-proof containers and place in appropriate shipping containers. Dry specimens or spilled-leaking specimens are not acceptable for AFB culture. Specimens submitted on swabs or sputums of low volume are discouraged for AFB culture because the yield is significantly decreased. Gastric contents must be neutralized with sodium carbonate or another alkaline buffer salt before transport. Respiratory specimens may be submitted for Mycobacterium tuberculosis amplification. Only specimens that are AFB stain positive are appropriate for testing. An AFB culture and smear should be ordered in conjunction with this request. This test is specific for, but does not differentiate between, members of the M. tuberculosis complex, i.e. M. tuberculosis, M. bovis BCG, M. africanum and M. micrati. A negative test does not exclude the possibility of isolating M. tuberculosis complex from the AFB culture.","type":"file","id":"laboratory-medicine"},"laboratory-medicine/clinical-biochemistry":{"title":"Clinical Biochemistry","body":"Clinical Biochemistry provides a broad array of routine and specialized clinical laboratory testing services on blood, urine, and other body fluids.

For questions or additional details regarding the policies and procedures described here, please contact Client Services. Animal Specimens We do not accept animal specimens for laboratory testing. Cancellation of Tests Cancellations received prior to test setup will be honored at no charge. We cannot accommodate cancellation requests received following test setup. A report will be issued automatically and charged as indicated. Compliance Policies Cleveland Clinic Laboratories complies with all applicable laws and regulations such as the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) by developing, implementing and monitoring appropriate policies, procedures and processes. Compliance is overseen by several regulatory agencies, including the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and the Department of Transportation (DOT). Our clients are responsible for their compliance with regulations related to patient confidentiality, diagnosis coding, anti kick back statutes, professional courtesy, CPT-4 coding, CLIA proficiency testing and other similar regulatory requirements. Analyte Specific Reagents Analyte specific reagents (ASRs) are reagents of chemicals or antibodies that may be considered \"active ingredients\" of tests used to identify specific diseases or conditions. The reagents are purchased by clinical laboratories for use in the development of in house tests used in the diagnosis and management of various conditions. To meet FDA regulations, the laboratory provides a disclaimer on results from those in- house developed tests that incorporate ASRs. Genetic Testing Ongoing advances in genetic testing and associated regulations frequently require additional patient information and/or documentation of the patient's consent. If required information is not provided at the time of specimen submission, Cleveland Clinic Laboratories will contact the submitting facility to obtain the documentation prior to forwarding the specimen to the testing laboratory. Lead and Heavy Metal Testing State Departments of Health mandate testing laboratories to report specific patient demographics and heavy metal results directly to the state. Cleveland Clinic Laboratories conforms to all such requirements and provides a separate \"Heavy Metals Requisition\" for use by the client when ordering testing for lead, cadmium, arsenic or mercury. Clients must provide all requested information at the time of specimen submission to enable the laboratory to meet these requirements. Required information includes the following: Patient's date of birth, race, complete address, telephone number, sample type (venous or capillary) Guardian's name and phone number (children only) Name and address of patient's place of employment Referring physician's name, address, telephone number and UPIN Patient's date of birth, race, complete address, telephone number, sample type (venous or capillary) Guardian's name and phone number (children only) Name and address of patient's place of employment Referring physician's name, address, telephone number and UPIN Specimens received without the required information will not be tested. The client will be contacted and asked to submit the missing information. If such information is not received within one week of specimen submission, the specimen will be discarded. HHS/OIG Compliance Policies Cleveland Clinic Laboratories participates in an active compliance plan, which follows the outline of the Health and Human Services, Office of the Inspector General (HHS/OIG) program. All ordering physicians need to be fully informed and aware of the specific activities associated with the government compliance program and the requirements that include but are not limited to the following practices, policies and procedures: Medicare regulations require only tests that are medically necessary for diagnosis or treatment of a patient may be billed. Each laboratory test request requires appropriate medical necessity (ICD 9 codes). Screening tests (with a few specifically cited exceptions) that are billed to Medicare will be denied reimbursement. Medicare may not pay for non- FDA-approved tests or tests that are identified as \"research use only.\" Each individual test component within the Organ and Disease Related Panels must meet the criteria of medical necessity. If all component tests within a panel do not meet the criteria of medical necessity, a physician should order individual tests or a more appropriate panel. When there is a likelihood that an ordered laboratory test will not be paid by Medicare, the patient should be informed and asked to sign an Advance Beneficiary Notice (ABN), Form No. CMS-R-131-L(June 2001). The signed ABN indicates to the patient the specific test(s) and charge(s) that he/she is responsible for in the event Medicare denies payment. A reflex test is a specific laboratory test in which an abnormal result causes one or more additional tests to be automatically ordered, resulted and billed. The reflex test list is reviewed and approved by Cleveland Clinic's governing administrative bodies annually. All of these tests are also identified in this Cleveland Clinic Laboratories Test Directory.

Confidentiality of Results Cleveland Clinic Laboratories is committed to maintaining confidentiality of patient information and to compliance with all privacy, security, and electronic transaction code requirements of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA). All services provided that involve joint efforts will be done in such a way that our clients are compliant with requirements defined by HIPAA and the College of American Pathologists (CAP). To ensure compliance with HIPAA for appropriate release of patient results, we have adopted the following policy: For the laboratory to release information regarding patient results by phone or email, the patient must sign the HIPAA release form. Federal regulations permit the release of results only to ordering physicians or healthcare providers responsible for the individual patient's care. Third parties requesting results, including requests directly from the patient, are directed to the ordering facility.

Federal regulations permit the release of results only to ordering physicians or healthcare providers responsible for the individual patient's care. Third parties requesting results, including requests directly from the patient, are directed to the ordering facility. We appreciate your assistance in helping Cleveland Clinic Laboratories preserve patient confidentiality. Critical Result Notification Cleveland Clinic Laboratories will immediately notify the individual who requested a test when any result indicates an imminent, life threatening condition. This policy is compliance with CLIA regulation 493.1109 (f). Critical values of certain tests will be reported immediately by phone to the client who ordered the test, regardless of the time of day. Infectious Material All specimens are handled as though they are infectious. The greatest dangers to healthcare workers exposed to blood and body fluids are the hepatitis B, hepatitis C and HIV viruses. Cleveland Clinic Reference Laboratories has an extensive safety policy that adheres to guidelines provided by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), the Department of Labor and the Department of Health and Human Services. Written exposure control plans are in place. In addition, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) has listed organisms/diseases that require the use of special packaging and labeling. Shipping regulations require that infectious substances affecting humans be shipped in a special manner. A copy of the regulations is available on the International Air Transport Association website at www.iata.org/ps/publications/issg.htm or by calling 514 399-6770. www.iata.org/ps/publications/issg.htm Physician Name and Number Requests Our goal is always to deliver accurate, high quality, timely results so that diagnostic and treatment decisions can be made as quickly as possible for patient care. At times, Cleveland Clinc Laboratories needs to contact the ordering physician directly, particularly when we are conducting esoteric tests. At times we need the ordering physician's name and phone number to clarify requested services, interpret a test result or otherwise consult with the ordering physician as necessary. If this information was not provided on the test order where indicated, Cleveland Clinic Laboratories may request this information from our client. We appreciate your rapid assistance in supplying us with the ordering physician's name and phone number so that we may contact him or her as needed. Working together, we can provide your patients with the highest quality testing services in the shortest possible time. Proficiency Testing Cleveland Clinic Laboratories has a strict policy regarding proficiency testing (PT) to comply with CMS regulations. The Cleveland Clinic Laboratories will neither accept nor perform testing on proficiency testing material from the College of American Pathologists (CAP) or any other CLIA approved PT provider. If proficiency testing material is submitted to the Cleveland Clinic Reference Laboratory by a Client and the proficiency testing period is in progress, the samples will be returned and the CAP (our accreditation agency for CLIA certification) will be notified. Additionally, Cleveland Clinic Laboratories will neither communicate nor share with Clients proficiency testing survey results that are actively in progress. Cleveland Clinic will cooperate in alternate assessment programs with other laboratories as allowed by federal regulation. Quality Assurance Extensive proficiency testing and quality control measures assure that each specimen is provided the full benefits of in house quality, expertise and knowledge.

The Quality Coordinating Team and senior management monitor performance indicators for all laboratory services. Performance improvement initiatives are regularly instituted and reviewed as part of an aggressive on-going quality improvement program. Client Services telephone call are monitored and recorded for quality assurance. Radioactive Specimens Cleveland Clinic Laboratories does not routinely test specimens for background radioactivity. This radioactivity may interfere with the results of radioimmunoassasy; therefore, specimens from patients receiving radioactive tracers or material should be labeled as such. Record Retention Cleveland Clinic Laboratories retains all test requisitions for 15 years, and patient test results are retained indefinitely. A copy of the original report can be reconstructed including reference ranges, interpretive comments, flags, and footnotes with the source system as the Pathology and Laboratory Medicine Institute's laboratory information system. Referral Testing Policy Cleveland Clinic Laboratories serves its clients by selecting and using qualified, licensed reference laboratories to perform those tests not available at Cleveland Clinic. Laboratories are identified based on the quality of service provided. Such services include, but are not limited to, accuracy, reliability, turnaround time, customer service, ease of reporting and range of services offered. Clients may, for medical reasons, request that a test be referred to a specific laboratory other than Cleveland Clinic or one which is routinely utilized by Cleveland Clinic Laboratories. Following consultation with the client regarding such requests, Cleveland Clinic Laboratories will honor the client's request and forward the specimen. In the event that Cleveland Clinic Laboratories must refer a test to another laboratory, we invoice for such testing at the price charged to Cleveland Clinic Laboratories plus an administrative fee per test. When a est is referred at the request of the client, a service fee of $30 is charged in addition to the routine administrative fee and the cost of the test. Prices are subject to change without notice. Reflex Testing Some tests, under certain conditions, may result in an order for an additional test(s) placed by and at the discretion of the clinical pathologist. Reflex Testing List Reportable Disease Cleveland Clinic Laboratories strives to comply with state health department requirements regarding reportable diseases. We make our report electronically, by fax or phone, depending upon the individual state's health department regulations. Reports are made to the state listed in the client address. Clients are responsible for compliance with any state specific statutes concerning reportable conditions, including but not limited to chromosomal abnormality registries. Specimen Containers In response to OSHA standards and good laboratory practices, the laboratory will not accept, transport or test any specimen contained in a syringe with a needle attached. The use of glass tubes, especially for frozen specimens, should be avoided due to the increased risk of broken glass and biological contamination. Acceptable transport tubes are available upon request from Cleveland Clinic Laboratories (contact Client Services). Client Services Specimen Labeling All specimens submitted for testing must be labeled with the patient's complete name or identifying number as written on the Test Request Form. This will assure positive identification and optimum integrity of patient specimens from the time of collection until testing has been completed and results reported. Clients will be notified of inappropriately labeled specimens, and the specimen will be returned to the client. Unlabeled or incompletely labeled specimens will not be tested (see Specimen Rejection Criteria below). Specimen Rejection Criteria Specimens will be rejected and the tests and charges canceled under the following conditions: Unlabeled or incompletely labeled specimens Name on specimen does not match name on requisition or electronic order Leaking specimen Broken container Incorrect specimen submitted for test requested Insufficient volume (QNS) Improper specimen transport temperature Age of the specimen (test dependent) Hemolysis (test dependent) Specimens received with no written or electronic order Unlabeled or incompletely labeled specimens Name on specimen does not match name on requisition or electronic order Leaking specimen Broken container Incorrect specimen submitted for test requested Insufficient volume (QNS) Improper specimen transport temperature Age of the specimen (test dependent) Hemolysis (test dependent) Specimens received with no written or electronic order Specimen Volume Specific specimen requirements for each test are provided in the Test Directory. Submit the quantity specified for each test requested. Tests will be canceled as \"QNS\" (Quantity Not Sufficient) when the sample volume is inadequate and will be indicated as such on the report. As a general rule, the volume of blood drawn should equal 2 1/2 times the amount of serum plasma required. For example, to obtain 4mL serum or plasma, draw at least 10mL blood. When inappropriate or insufficient specimens are submitted, the laboratory will store them and contact the requesting facility to request that the specimen be recollected. Documentation of this action will appear on the report. If you have concerns about the volume of a specimen being submitted, please contact Client Services to discuss the test and specimen available. A staff member can advise you whether an alternative technique is available that can accommodate the lesser specimen volume. Test Result Call Backs Clients may request results to be delivered by telephone. The request for a phone report may be made on the Test Request Form or by calling Cleveland Clinic Laboratories. Time Sensitive Specimens Please contact Client Services before sending a specimen for testing of a time sensitive nature. We will ask for the following information: Facility name Account number Patient name and/or Cleveland Clinic Laboratories accession number Shipping information (i.e., courier service, FedEx®, etc.) Date to be sent Test ordered Facility name Account number Patient name and/or Cleveland Clinic Laboratories accession number Shipping information (i.e., courier service, FedEx®, etc.) Date to be sent Test ordered Place specimen in a separate Cleveland Clinic Laboratories temperature appropriate bag.

Shipping containers, sterile specimen containers, transport media and swabs are available through Client Services. Specimen containers must be tightened securely to prevent leakage. Labeling Clearly print the patient’s complete name (as listed on the test request form) on the specimen container, culturette, or other specimen transport media. (Labeling of only the outside container is not acceptable). Transport Deliver specimens to the laboratory within 24 hours. Prompt processing minimizes loss in viability of potential pathogens and ensures a more accurate appraisal of flora present. Specimen Rejection Criteria for Microbiology Specimens Client Services will notify the ordering facility or healthcare provider of any test cancellations. Common causes for rejection of microbiology specimens are: Inappropriate specimen for culture requested Improper specimen container or transport media Inappropriate specimen for culture requested Improper specimen container or transport media General Microbiology Culture Types and Collection Instructions Blood The detection of microorganisms in blood has great diagnostic and prognostic importance. A completed test request form (particularly time of collection, diagnosis and antimicrobial therapy) is essential for timely and appropriate laboratory processing of the specimen. All routine blood cultures are screened for aerobic and anaerobic bacterial and fungal isolates. All organisms isolated from blood cultures will be identified, susceptibility tests performed, if appropriate, and stock cultures made, unless the isolate is considered a skin contaminant. Stock cultures will be held for 30 days. Organisms that may be contaminants are coagulase negative Staphylococcus species, Bacillus species, diphtheroid bacilli and viridans Streptococcus species. Blood cultures from patients suspected of having Brucella must be specifically requested as special cultures. (See the individual culture listings of the specific organisms for further details). Guidelines for Drawing Cultures In most adult infections, cultures of two to three separate venipunctures (20 30 mL per venipuncture) are sufficient. Studies have shown the following positive blood culture yields within a 24-hour period in patients without endocarditis: First venipuncture (Set): 80% First and second venipunctures (Set): 90% First, second and third venipunctures (Set): 99% Based on these results, the laboratory will not accept more than four blood culture sets per 24 hours per patient. In suspected acute sepsis, meningitis, osteomyelitis, arthritis or acute untreated bacterial pneumonia, obtain two blood culture sets (from two separate venipuncture sites) before starting therapy. For suspected infective endocarditis. Acute: Obtain three blood culture sets with three separate venipunctures during the first one to two hours of evaluation. Subacute: Obtain three blood culture sets on Day 1 (15 minutes or more apart). If all three are negative at 24 hours, obtain three more. A direct correlation exists between the volume of blood cultured and the recovery rate of clinically significant organisms. For adult patients, each blood culture bottle should receive 10mL of blood. Isolators should receive 10mL as indicated on the tube. For pediatric patients, one to five mL of blood injected into one aerobic blood culture bottle is sufficient.

Specimen Collection After placing a tourniquet on the patient's arm, select a suitable vein. Once the vein has been found, cleanse the area with the series of 2% iodine, 70% alcohol, iodine and alcohol. Without touching the site of the venipuncture with the fingers, draw 20mL of blood into a sterile syringe. Inject 10mL of the specimen into each of two culture bottles after cleansing the stoppers with 2% iodine. Invert the containers several times to insure thorough mixture of the contents. (Blood culture systems are available through Client Services). For pediatric patients, write the volume of blood inoculated on the label. Blood cultures from patients suspected of having Histoplasma capsulatum, Brucella, Bartonella, Legionella or Mycobacterium must be specifically requested as special cultures and must be collected in a lysis centrifugation (Isolator™) tube.

Bacterial Complete a Test Request Form indicating the specific source of the specimen, diagnosis and organism(s) suspected. Label the specimen appropriately. Record the date and time the specimen was collected. Urine Submit specimens in urine culture transport tubes provided by Cleveland Clinic Laboratories. Indicate whether the specimen is from a clean catch or a catheter. Collection Guidelines: Clean Catch Indwelling Catheter Specimen Collection Obtain the specimen with a needle and syringe. Select the puncture site 1 2 inches away from the catheter tube entry point. Cleanse the area to be punctured with 70% alcohol. Aspirate exactly 5mL of urine with a sterile needle and syringe. Disinfect the rubber stopper and aseptically transfer the specimen to the urine transport tube provided. Specimens obtained from the collection bag are not suitable for analysis. Foley tips will not be accepted. Urine Culture Transport Prevention of contamination by normal vaginal, perineal, and anterior urethral flora is the most important consideration for collection of a clinically relevant urine specimen. (See the Patient Collection Guidelines above for collection of a urine specimen). Unpreserved urine is an excellent growth medium for most bacteria. Unless urine is preserved during transport, bacteria may multiply, causing colony counts to be erroneously high. The maintenance medium in the transport kit prevents rapid multiplication of bacteria in the urine during shipment. Instructions for use of urine culture transport system: Obtain the urine specimen from the patient in a clean cup. Open the pouch and remove the transfer device and tube. Submerge the pipette of the transfer device to the bottom of the urine container. The container may be tipped at an angle if the volume of the urine is limited. Place the transport tube in the holder portion of the transfer device and push it down as far as it will go, puncturing the stopper. Hold the tube and transfer device in position until the urine stops flowing into the tube. Remove the transport tube from the transfer device and shake the tube vigorously. Discard the transfer device and remaining cup of urine into appropriate biohazard disposal containers. Obtain the urine specimen from the patient in a clean cup.

Hold the tube and transfer device in position until the urine stops flowing into the tube. Remove the transport tube from the transfer device and shake the tube vigorously. Discard the transfer device and remaining cup of urine into appropriate biohazard disposal containers. Precaution: The transport tube must be filled to the minimum line indicated on the tube. A tube that is not filled at least to this line is unacceptable for culture. Precaution: Respiratory The following collection sites are considered respiratory specimens: mouth, nose, nasopharyngeal swabs, throat sputum, bronchial and tracheal aspirations, bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and Bartlett Fiberoptic Wimberly (BFW) brush. All specimens from these sites will be screened for fast growing aerobic pathogenic organisms and for Beta Strep Group A. The following organisms are examples of those not isolated by routine culture: Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Corynebacterium diphtheriae and Bordetella species. Specimens from the nose are the only respiratory specimens routinely screened for Haemophilus species. For information on culture of non routine organisms, see the culture listing for the specific organism. Stool Refer to the Test Directory for collection information. Specimens must be submitted in transport media provided by the laboratory. Test Directory Miscellaneous Specimens from normally sterile sites (such as body fluids, surgical specimens, joint fluids, etc.) will be cultured for aerobic pathogenic organisms. Anaerobic pathogens may be detected by routine cultures. However, be aware of the special requirements for the isolation of anaerobes. If an anaerobic organism is suspected, a specimen should be submitted for anaerobic culture. Bone marrow, eye swabs, joint fluids and cerebrospinal fluids are routinely screened for fast growing aerobic pathogenic bacteria including Haemophilus species and pathogenic Neisseria species. Body fluids (exclusive of joint or cerebrospinal fluids) and surgical specimens will be routinely screened for fast-growing aerobic pathogens. Genital tract specimens are tested for Neisseria gonorrhoeae and/or Chlamydia trachomatis by amplification. If Haemophilus ducreyi is suspected, a special request must be made. In cases of suspected toxic shock syndrome, the tentative diagnosis should be placed on the requisition form so that isolates of Staphylococcus aureus may be saved for TSST-1 testing. Vaginal specimens must be accompanied by a request for examination for a specific organism (i.e. group B streptococci, Candida, Trichomonias vaginalis) or for gram stain, which may be examined for the presence of clue cells, curved bacteria, relative proportion of gram-positive bacilli resembling lactobacilli vs. Gram-negative bacilli. Culture for Gardnerella vaginalis is neither sensitive nor specific for the diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis and will not be done. Specimens from wounds, ulcers, and drainages will be screened for nonfastidious, fast-growing aerobic organisms. If an anaerobe is suspected, a specimen must be properly submitted and an anaerobic culture specifically ordered. Specimens from normally sterile sites (such as body fluids, surgical specimens, joint fluids, etc.) will be cultured for aerobic pathogenic organisms. Anaerobic pathogens may be detected by routine cultures. However, be aware of the special requirements for the isolation of anaerobes. If an anaerobic organism is suspected, a specimen should be submitted for anaerobic culture. Bone marrow, eye swabs, joint fluids and cerebrospinal fluids are routinely screened for fast growing aerobic pathogenic bacteria including Haemophilus species and pathogenic Neisseria species.

If an anaerobe is suspected, a specimen must be properly submitted and an anaerobic culture specifically ordered. Nose or Nasopharyngeal Swabs Collect in a manner to avoid contamination by adjacent structures. Throat Specimens Collect in a manner to avoid contamination by mouth and tongue. Throat specimens will be screened for Group A Strep only. Throat specimens for Neisseria ganorrohoeae, Bordetella pertussis or Corynebacterium diphtheriae will be screened only for that pathogen when specifically requested. Collect in a manner to avoid contamination by mouth and tongue. Sputum Specimens Collect by instructing the patient to remove dentures, rinse mouth, gargle with water and cough deeply, expectorating into appropriate collection container. All specimens labeled \"sputum\" that are consistent on cytologic examination with saliva or upper respiratory secretions will be rejected. Rejection or acceptance will be based on microscopic examination for the absence of/or minimal numbers of squamous epithelial cells. Tracheal and Bronchial Aspiration Collect by physician to avoid contamination with adjacent structures. Fungus Provide complete information on the Test Request Form to ensure that the specimen is cultured for all organisms (fungi/yeast) suspected. Additional patient history may be helpful. Include the patient occupation, history of travel or residence abroad, and any animal contacts. A single specimen may be cultured for both bacteria and fungi. Generally, a direct fungal smear exam will be performed on all specimens submitted for fungal cultures. Yeast Requirements are the same as for a fungal culture. Urine, vaginal, throat and stool requests are routinely processed for a yeast culture, even if ordered as a fungal culture. Anaerobes Cultures for fastidious anaerobes will not be performed on urine (nonsuprapubic aspirate) or specimens from body sites that have anaerobes as part of the normal flora (stool, skin, vagina/cervix, mouth, throat, septum, etc.). Any material collected from areas with no normal flora (body fluids, deep abscess exudate, tissue biopsies, transtracheal aspirates, etc.) is acceptable for anaerobic culture. Specimens for anaerobic culture must be collected appropriately and transported in an anaerobic environment (anaerobe vial). Aspirated specimens, in general, are preferred. Swabs are unacceptable for anaerobe culture. Contact Client Services prior to collection of the specimen for consultation on collection procedures, containers, or transport. Client Services Acid Fast Bacillus All cultures and stains for AFB are performed at Cleveland Clinic. Acid fast stain results are generally available 24-48 hours from receipt of sample. Positive stains and/or culture results are called to the client. Transport specimens in sterile, leak-proof containers and place in appropriate shipping containers. Dry specimens or spilled-leaking specimens are not acceptable for AFB culture. Specimens submitted on swabs or sputums of low volume are discouraged for AFB culture because the yield is significantly decreased. Gastric contents must be neutralized with sodium carbonate or another alkaline buffer salt before transport. Respiratory specimens may be submitted for Mycobacterium tuberculosis amplification. Only specimens that are AFB stain positive are appropriate for testing. An AFB culture and smear should be ordered in conjunction with this request. This test is specific for, but does not differentiate between, members of the M. tuberculosis complex, i.e. M. tuberculosis, M. bovis BCG, M. africanum and M. micrati. A negative test does not exclude the possibility of isolating M. tuberculosis complex from the AFB culture.","type":"file","id":"specimen-collection-handling-instructions"},"subspecialty-consultative-services":{"title":"Subspecialty Consultative Services","body":"Cleveland Clinic offers second opinion reviews for surgical, cytology and hematopathology cases.

In this assay, standard plasmid DNA, containing a single copy of all three genes, is used as the copy number standard to generate standard curves and determine mitochondrial and cell copy number. The value reported is the average of three determinations quantified in one Real-Time PCR run. Cell copy number assumes diploid cells. If a mutation or deletion is present in one of the mitochondrial genes, its copy number value will be lower than the value determined from the other mitochondrial gene.

Immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) is a destructive thrombocytopenia caused by autoantibodies. Neonatal alloimmune thrombocytopenia (NATP) and post-transfusion purpura (PTP) are diseases where thrombocytopenia is caused by platelet-specific alloantibodies. HLA alloantibodies do not cause thrombocytopenia, but are commonly associated with refractoriness to platelet transfusions.

Leptin plays an important role in the regulation of body weight through the hypothalamic centers of hunger, body temperature and energy expenditure. Increased leptin levels are seen in obese individuals. The fact that elevated leptin levels fail to alter the obese state of these individuals may be related to a 'leptin resistance' and an inability of leptin to enter the cerebral spinal fluid to reach sites in the hypothalamus to regulate appetite. Leptin levels have been shown to change under certain endocrine conditions. For example, when leptin levels are expressed per body adiposity, females have higher leptin levels than do males. This may be related to the distribution of adipose tissue where omental fat vs. subcutaneous fat, which differs between genders, may have different leptin production rates. Its role in metabolism, insulin sensitivity, as a potential therapeutic modality for weight loss, as well as, involvement in endocrine function are still under investigation.","type":"beaker","id":"test/?ID=3201"},"test/?ID=3202":{"title":"Leptospira Antibody","alias":null,"lis":"LEPTAB","lfs":"75396","cpt":"86720(x1)","body":"Aid in the diagnosis of acute, febrile systemic illnesses as well as other milder manifestations caused by leptospiral infections.

The patient's autoAb profile is more informative than the result of any single test for supporting a diagnosis of MG, and for predicting the likelihood of thymoma. Muscle AChR and striational autoAbs are characteristic but not diagnostic of MG. One or both are found in 13% of patients with Lambert-Eaton Syndrome (LES), but P/Q-type calcium channel autoAbs are rare in MG. Results are sometimes positive in patients with neoplasia without evidence of neurological impairment. Titers are generally higher in patients with severe weakness or with thymoma, but severity cannot be predicted by antibody titer. When the initial autoAb profile is consistent with thymoma, detection of CRMP-5-IgG increases the likelihood of thymoma. Test results for AChR and striational antibodies may be negative for 6 - 12 months after MG symptom onset. Only 8% of nonimmunosuppressed patients with generalized MG remain seronegative beyond 12 months for all autoAbs in the adult MG evaluation. About 38% of those patients will have the recently described alternative autoAb MuSK.  MuSK antibody-positive patients are reported to lack thymoma, and have predominantly oculobulbar symptoms that respond to plasmapheresis and immunosuppressant therapy. They do not benefit from thymectomy. Cautions: A positive result in this evaluation is not per se diagnostic of MG. Positive values for muscle antibodies (AChR or striational) occur in 13% of LES patients, 40% of patients with autoimmune liver disorders, approximately 10% of patients with lung cancer, and in patients with graft-versus-host disease, and recipients of D-penicillamine.

Muscle AChR and striational autoAbs are characteristic but not diagnostic of MG. One or both are found in 13% of patients with LES, but calcium channel antibodies are not found in MG. Muscle AChR binding antibody is found in 90% of non-immunosuppressed MG patients who have thymoma, and 80% have a striational antibody. Calcium channel antibodies have not been encountered with thymoma. The likelihood of thymoma is greatest when striational antibody is accompanied by a high muscle AChR modulating antibody value (= or > 90% AChR loss). Detection of CRMP-5-IgG also is consistent with thymoma in patients not at risk for lung carcinoma. N-type calcium channel antibodies are more highly associated with primary lung cancer than P/Q-type. One or all of the autoAbs in the MG/LES evaluation can occur with neoplasia without evidence of neurological impairment. Calcium channel antibodies may disappear soon after commencing immunosuppressant therapy. Other serological markers of lung cancer also may disappear. One or both calcium channel antibodies (P/Q and N) can occur with paraneoplastic and idiopathic cerebellar ataxia, encephalomyeloneuropathies, and autonomic neuropathy.

HSV can infect neonates, children and adults. HSV is transmitted primarily by direct contact with infected secretions from symptomatic or an asymptomatic person. Lesions on the skin and mucous membranes of the mouth and genitals characterize most HSV positive cases. HSV infection can be either primary (>90% of these cases are asymptomatic) or recurrent (secondary). Primary infection with HSV-1 can lead to, among others, gingivostomatitis, eczema herpeticum, keratoconjunctivitis and encephalitis. Primary infection with HSV-2 occurs as, among others, vulvovaginitis, meningitis and generalized herpes in newborns. The primary symptoms of a secondary infection are skin lesions in the nose, mouth and genital regions. Even more severe are the recurrent forms of keratoconjunctivitis and meningitis. Although HSV is responsible for 5-10% of all cases of acute viral encephalitis in the US, it is the most common cause of severe sporadic encephalitis. HSV-1 and HSV-2 can cause encephalitis in neonates, most cases of HSV encephalitis in older children are the results of HSV-1 infection. The detection of HSV DNA in the CSF of patients with suspected HSV encephalitis allows a rapid and non-invasive confirmation of the diagnosis. A negative test result does not exclude disease. Clinical history, symptoms and findings are necessary since HSV DNA may not be detectable in early acute stages and DNA levels fall over time.","type":"beaker","id":"test/?ID=3009"},"test/?ID=3011":{"title":"Herpes Simplex IgM, Abs","alias":"HSV IgM","lis":"HSVM","lfs":"50166","cpt":"86695(x1)","body":"Test to determine if herpes infection is current or recent  Significant cross-reactivity exists between type I and II herpes antibodies.

Compromised renal function significantly decreases the rate of elimination and causes fluconazole to accumulate. Distributioin and elimination are similar in adults, children as young as age 2 months, and in geriatric patients. Fluconazole does not undergo extensive hepatic metabolism. However, fluconazole is a potent inhibitor of CYP2C9, which affects drugs metabolized by this system such as benzodiazepines, cyclosporine, statins, phenytoin, sirolimus, tacrolimus, and warfarin.

The qualitative VWF defects include type 2, which is further classified as 4 subtypes by different pathophysiologic mechanisms.  Accurate laboratory diagnosis and classification of VWD are crucial because the presenting biological activitiy of VWF determines both the hemorrhagic risk and subsequent clinical managment. The collagen binding activity (CBA) assay has been proposed as a supplemental test for VWF activity.  The CBA assay is based on the ability of multimeric forms of VWF to bind collagen and its greatest strength lies in the ability to selectively detect primarily high molecular weight (HMW) forms of VWF, which are known to be most functional and adhesive.  The CBA assay is a useful adjunctive to diagnose VWD, and differentiate VWD with deficiency of HMW multimer forms in type 2A and type 2B from type 1.  It can also differentiate very low levels of VWF in severe type 1 from complete absence of VWF in type 3.

Although cholera can be life-threatening, it is easily prevented and treated. In the United States, because of advanced water and sanitation systems, cholera is not a major threat; however, everyone, especially travelers to parts of the world that are endemic can ingest contaminated water or food products and develop the disease. Symptoms of cholera include profuse watery diarrhea and vomiting; the stool may have a characteristic rice water appearance. Dehydration and electrolyte imbalance can result without appropriate diagnosis and treatment. When ingested, another species of Vibrio, V. parahaemolyticus, can cause watery diarrhea often with abdominal cramping, nausea, vomiting, fever and chills. Usually these symptoms occur within 24 hours of ingestion. Illness is usually self-limited and lasts 3 days. Severe disease is rare and occurs more commonly in persons with weakened immune systems. In most laboratories, recovery of Vibrio sp. requires a special stool culture request. The routine enteric pathogen culture can recover the more common agents of bacterial diarrhea, Salmonella, Shigella, Campylobacter and E. coli that can be responsible for bloody diarrhea and hemorrhagic colitis; if Vibrio is a potential etiology of the patient's diarrhea, a stool culture for Vibrio should be ordered.","type":"beaker","id":"test/?ID=4419"},"test/?ID=4420":{"title":"Posaconazole, Serum","alias":"Noxafil","lis":"POSACN","lfs":"88031","cpt":"80299(x1)","body":"Useful for monitoring of posaconazole therapy.

Its antithrombotic mechanism is antithrombin-mediated selective inhibition of factor Xa after binding fondaparinux with antithrombin. However, fondaparinux does not inactivate thrombin and has no effect in platelet function or fibrinolysis. The Fondaparinux Activity assay allows the determination of the plasma levels of fondaparinux by measuring its acceleration of inhibition of activated factor X using a chromogenic substrate method using calibration curve calculated with a commercial Arixtra (fondaparanux) calibrator. This assay cannot be used to monitor patients receiving unfractionated or low molecular weight heparins. Fondaparinux has a half life of approximately 17-21 hours in healthy normal individuals, however, it can be prolonged in patients with renal impairment because fondaparinux is mainly eliminated in urine. While patients treated with fondaparinux are not typically monitored, there is clinical need for monitoring and therapeutic assessment in patients with bleeding or thrombotic complications.\n\nIn patients undergoing treatment with fondaparinux sodium injection 2.5 mg, once daily, the peak steady-state plasma concentration is, on average, 0.39 to 0.50 mg/L and is reached approximately 3 hours post-dose. In these patients, the minimum steady-state plasma concentration is 0.14 to 0.19 mg/L. In patients with symptomatic deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism undergoing treatment with fondaparinux sodium injection 5 mg (body weight <50 kg), 7.5 mg (body weight 50 to 100 kg), and 10 mg (body weight >100 kg) once daily, the body-weight-adjusted doses provide similar mean steady-state peaks and minimum plasma concentrations across all body weight categories. The mean peak steady-state plasma concentration is in the range of 1.20 to 1.26 mg/L. In these patients, the mean minimum steady-state plasma concentration is in the range of 0.46 to 0.62 mg/L.

Normally, there are fewer than 45 CGG triplet repeats but affected individuals have greater than 200 CGG repeats. These full mutations result in hypermethylation of the promoter region, with subsequest silencing of gene expression and absence of the FMR1 protein (FMRP). Alleles with 55 to 200 CGG repeats are considered premutations; they do not cause fragile X syndrome but are prone to meiotic instability and may expand to full mutations in one generation. 20% of women with premutations experience premature ovarian insufficiency (POI), with onset of menopause before the age of 40. Fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS), a late-onset neurodegenerative condition, has been identified as an FMR1-related disorder.

Post vaccination samples should be obtained at 4 weeks post-immunization. A single sample provides only general immune status of an individual to various serotypes of pneumococci. Immune response to pneumococci may vary in different individuals based on the age, vaccination status, immunologic competence and the serotype of the organism. Long-term protection is generally considered to be a serotype antibody level of 1.3 ug/mL or greater. Following vaccination, an antibody ratio of less than twofold is considered a non-responder; a ratio of two- to fourfold is a weak responder; a ratio of fourfold or greater is a good responder. The higher the pre-vaccination antibody level for a specific pneumococcal serotype, the less likely the response will increase significantly after vaccination. An increased antibody level to 50 - 70% or more of the serotypes is thought to represent a normal humoral response. In the case of pure polysaccharide vaccine, indication of immune system competence is further delineated as an adequate response to at least 70% of the serotypes in the vaccine challenge for those 6 - 65 years of age, or to at least 50% of the serotypes in the vaccine challenge for those 2 - 5 years of age.","type":"beaker","id":"test/?ID=4995"},"test/?ID=4999":{"title":"Executive Panel Nicotine/Cotinine","alias":null,"lis":"EXNICO","lfs":"","cpt":"83887(x1)","body":"WHILE USING A TOBACCO PRODUCT: Peak Nicotine concentration: 30 ng/mL - 50 ng/mL; Peak Cotinine concentration: 200 ng/mL - 800 ng/mL (higher values may be seen in subjects with high cytochrome P450 2D6 activity).

Rivaroxaban binds directly to the catalytic site of the serine protease factor Xa independently of antithrombin, and inhibits both free and prothrombinase-bound factor Xa. \n\nIt is indicated to prevent and treat thromboembolic disorders such as ischemic stroke, systemic embolism or nonvalvular atrial fibrillation. It also reduces the risk of recurrence of deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism in patients receiving orthopedic surgery. Rivaroxaban can provide more consistent and predictable anticoagulation than other anticoagulants such as warfarin.\n\nRoutine laboratory monitoring for rivaroxaban is not necessary. However, rivaroxaban measurement will be necessary in patients suspicious of poor compliance or failure of therapy, patients who require potential dose adjustment or patients with hepatic/renal dysfunction. As a direct factor Xa inhibitor, clotting times of coagulation tests downstream from factor Xa including PT and APTT will be prolonged.\n\nRivaroxaban will be measured by chromogenic anti-Xa assay using specific STA-Rivaroxaban in STA-R Evolution coagulometer.","type":"beaker","id":"test/?ID=4921"},"test/?ID=4963":{"title":"Hepatitis E Antibody IgM","alias":null,"lis":"HEPIGM","lfs":"89755","cpt":"86790(x1)","body":"Hepatitis E causes an acute, self-limiting infection.
