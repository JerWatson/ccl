<h3>Patient</h3>
<ul>

	<li>All information must be provided as outlined on the Test Request Form. If the required information is incomplete the client will be required to assume responsibility and will be billed for all charges.</li>

<h2>CPT Coding</h2>
<p> CPT Codes are provided (in the Test Directory) as a convenience to our clients as guidance to assist you in billing. Since CPT codes are subject to  change at any time, it is your responsibility to verify their accuracy for the test performed.</p>
<p>For tests that involve several component tests, the Test Directory attempts to provide a comprehensive list of CPT codes for all of the possible  components of the test. However, only a subset of component tests may  be performed on your specimen. You should verify accuracy of codes  listed. When multiple codes are listed, select codes for the tests actually  performed on your specimen.</p>
<p> Clients are encouraged to consult the CPT Coding Manual published by  the American Medical Association and to address questions regarding the  use of any particular code to their local Medicare carrier.</p>
<p> Cleveland Clinic Laboratories does not assume responsibility for billing errors due to reliance on CPT codes listed in the Test Directory.</p>
