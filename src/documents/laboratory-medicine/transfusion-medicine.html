<p class="lead">The Transfusion Medicine Core Laboratory (TMCL) pursues one overriding objective: to provide adequate amounts of safe blood in a timely manner for hospital patients.</p>
<p>We supply the complete menu of blood component options 24 hours-a-day, seven days a week. Integrated into the activities of the transfusion service are the donor program, the human progenitor cell processing and storage laboratory, viral marker testing for organ transplantation, and the intraoperative autotransfusion program.</p>
<p>The sectionâ€™s Perioperative Autotransfusion Service was the first in the country to be accredited by the American Association of Blood Banks (AABB). This service performs nearly 1,000 procedures each year, harvesting and transfusing the equivalent of about 2,500 units of Autologous Red Blood Cells. This service is actively researching better methods to manage preoperative anemia and complex intraoperative hemostasis problems.</p>
