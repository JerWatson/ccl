<p class="lead">Immunopathology comprises testing that focuses on the function of the immune system, both normal and pathological. Immune function can be assessed by measurement of immunoglobulin levels and subtyping analysis. Specialized testing is also available to evaluate cellular immune function. Testing for systemic autoimmunity (such as anti-nuclear antibody screening, and multiplex ENA analysis), and organ specific autoimmunity (such as celiac disease, Myasthenia Gravis, thyroid autoimmune diseases and diabetes antibody assays) is performed using various immunologic techniques such as direct immunoflourescence.</p>
<p>The immunopathology test menu also includes more than 100 allergens, as well as infectious disease serologies such as rubella, hepatitis, fungal and syphilis. Serum and urine protein electrophoresis is also performed in this area.</p>
