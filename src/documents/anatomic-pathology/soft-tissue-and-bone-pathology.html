    <p class="lead">The Soft Tissue and Bone Consultative Service of Cleveland Clinic Laboratories offers comprehensive evaluation of benign and malignant neoplasms arising in bone and soft tissue as well as mesenchymal neoplasms of the skin and parenchymal organs.</p>

    <h2>Experience and Expertise</h2>
    <p>Soft tissue and bone pathology consultative services are provided by Drs. Thomas Bauer, John Goldblum, Brian Rubin and Steven Billings, who are nationally and internationally recognized as experts in the field. They provide expert primary diagnoses and second opinions on some of the most difficult cases in bone and soft tissue pathology. In addition to outside consultative services, they also provide in-house diagnostic pathology through their clinical practice at Cleveland Clinic, a respected international tertiary referral center for cancer and musculoskeletal diseases.</p>

    <h2>Consultative Services</h2>
    <p>Soft tissue and primary bone tumors are rare, and include benign and malignant neoplasms that are diverse in histologic appearance and biologic behavior. Accurate diagnosis, grading and staging are essential for appropriate treatment. In part because these lesions are so rare, many pathologists find the diagnosis of soft tissue and bone tumors to be extremely challenging. Our pathologists have extensive experience with the diagnosis of bone and soft tissue tumors, and have written authoritative work concerning many of these tumors. Consultation is available at any stage of diagnosis or treatment.</p>

    <h2>Available Testing and Analysis</h2>
    <p>Our consultative service offers state-of-the-art tests to aid in diagnosis, including:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Immunohistochemistry</li>
      <li>Molecular analysis</li>
      <li>Cytogenetics</li>
      <li>Electron microscopy</li>
    </ul>
