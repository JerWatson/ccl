<p>Cleveland Clinic offers second opinion reviews for surgical, cytology and hematopathology cases. Specimens submitted to Cleveland Clinic Laboratories are triaged to one of our subspecialty teams. This subspecialty approach ensures that every specimen submitted to Cleveland Clinic Laboratories is evaluated by a pathologist with a high level of diagnostic expertise in that specific field of pathology. Each subspecialty service regularly conducts consensus review sessions of unique and challenging cases to leverage the diagnostic expertise of each team member.</p>
