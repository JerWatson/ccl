<p class="lead">Microbiology offers comprehensive testing for patients with infectious diseases. Our high quality, state-of-the-art diagnostic services including Microbiology Molecular Testing, combined with readily available consultation with pathologists and laboratory scientists have made us a national referral center for microbiology testing.</p>
<p>Our staff is committed to improving and advancing the diagnosis of infectious diseases. They are responsible for the development and evaluation of several innovative molecular tests for the rapid identification and characterization of infectious agents. The results of their studies have been published in leading medical journals, and these new tests, already in use at Cleveland Clinic, are becoming the standard of care in laboratories nationwide.</p>

<h2>Test Request Form</h2>
<p>Submit a completed Test Request Form for each culture requested. Information regarding the patient, the specific source of the specimen, collection time and date, clinical history, symptoms and diagnosis, antimicrobial therapy (or use of any other chemotherapeutic agents) and any suspected organism(s) is essential for the optimal and appropriate processing of the specimen. If an organism is sent for identification, the suspected organism or type must also be indicated. Clearly indicate the source and type of culture requested as well as the date and time the specimen was collected.</p>

<h2>Results Reporting</h2>
<p>Preliminary and final results for Microbiology are included on the patient report. Preliminary results will be called to the client on any positive, significant culture (e.g., blood, CSF, sterile body fluid and Salmonella or Shigella isolates) or stain. Results or interpretations of results may be obtained by contacting Client Services.</p>
