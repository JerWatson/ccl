<h2>Background</h2>

<p>Fragile X syndrome (OMIM#300624) is the most common
inherited cause of intellectual disability, with an incidence of
approximately 1 in 4,000 males and 1 in 8,000 females.
The syndrome was first recognized in 1977 when Sutherland
linked a fragile site on the X chromosome with the phenotype
of X-linked mental retardation and macroorchidism.
<sup>1</sup>
The
FMR1
gene was isolated in 1991 and PCR-based testing
has since been used to make or confirm diagnoses of fragile X
syndrome.
<sup>2</sup>
In most cases, fragile X syndrome is caused by a
trinucleotide (CGG) repeat expansion in the 5’ untranslated
(UTR) region of the gene. Normally, there are fewer than 45
CGG triplet repeats but affected individuals have greater than
200 CGG repeats. These full mutations of the CGG region
result in hypermethylation of the promoter region, with
subsequent silencing of gene expression and absence of the
FMR1 protein (FMRP). Severity of symptoms of fragile X
syndrome tend not to be affected by the number of trinucleotide repeats in the full mutation allele. However, individuals
are less severely affected if they carry unmethylated full
mutation allele or are mosaic for the full and premutation
alleles. About 30-50% of females with full mutation are
significantly affected.</p>

<p>Alleles with 55 to 200 CGG repeats are considered premutations; they do not cause fragile X syndrome but are prone to
meiotic instability and may expand to full mutations in one
generation. For reasons that are unclear, such expansions
occur more often in female meiosis. Approximately 1 in 250
females is a carrier of an
FMR1
premutation and at risk of
having a child with fragile X syndrome.
<sup>3</sup>
In addition, about
20% of women with premutations experience premature
ovarian insufficiency (POI), with onset of menopause before
the age of 40.
<sup>4</sup>
POI is not seen with increased frequency
among women with full mutations. </p>

<p>Fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS), a
late-onset neurodegenerative condition, has been identified
as an
FMR1
-related disorder. FXTAS is seen predominantly
in men, with onset after 50 years of age. The penetrance
among male premutation carriers increases with age, with
75% showing symptoms by the ninth decade of life.
<sup>5</sup>
Women
also have a risk of developing FXTAS but with lower frequency
and milder phenotype, due to random X-inactivation of the
expanded allele. In contrast to the gene silencing that occurs
in alleles with full mutations, premutations are associated
with an up-regulation of transcription resulting in a toxic
accumulation of
FMR1
mRNA, usually in the presence of
normal or slightly decreased protein levels. An intermediate,
or “gray zone,” also exists in the
FMR1
gene. Alleles containing
45 to 54 CGG repeats may also be unstable in meiosis but
do not expand to full mutations in a single generation.</p>

<h2>Clinical Indications</h2>

<p><strong>Fragile X Syndrome</strong>:
The clinical phenotype associated with
fragile X syndrome is variable and may be subtle in females.
Therefore, the American College of Medical Genetics and
Genomics (ACMG) suggests that testing be considered in all
individuals with intellectual disability, developmental delay
or autism, and especially in the presence of other fragile X
characteristics or a family history of fragile X syndrome or
undiagnosed mental retardation.
<sup>4</sup></p>

<p><strong>Premature Ovarian Insufficiency</strong>:
Further, ACMG and the
American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG)
recommend testing for women with evidence of premature
ovarian insufficiency, i.e. infertility associated with elevated
follicle stimulating hormone (FSH).
<sup>4,6</sup>
As above,
FMR1
testing
should especially be considered when there is an accompa-
nying family history of fragile X syndrome or undiagnosed
mental retardation, or if there is family history of premature
ovarian failure. </p>

<p><strong>Fragile X Associated Tremor/Ataxia Syndrome</strong>:
FMR1
testing
should also be considered in men and women with late onset
cerebellar ataxia and intention tremor, especially in the
presence of family history of movement disorders, fragile X
syndrome or undiagnosed mental retardation.
<sup>4</sup></p>

<p><strong>Carrier Testing</strong>:
Reproductive carrier testing for fragile X
syndrome is recommended for individuals with known family
history of fragile X syndrome or with family history of undiag-
nosed intellectual disability. Population carrier screening for
fragile X syndrome is not currently recommended due to the
complex clinical implications of identifying expanded alleles.
The approach to genetic counseling for the diverse phenotypes
associated with premutations and full mutations has not yet
been adequately addressed.
<sup>4</sup></p>

<h2>Methodology</h2>

<p>Determination of CGG expansion status is performed by PCR
and capillary electrophoresis using the Amplidex
FMR1
kit
from Asuragen. PCR is performed on DNA isolated from
peripheral blood using labeled primers designed to amplify
the
FMR1
repeat region by triplet repeat primed-PCR assay
(TP-PCR). PCR products are run on the ABI 3730 Genetic
Analyzer to determine the size(s) of the repeat expansion.
This TP-PCR assay identified normal to full mutation
FMR1
alleles at 100% specificity and 97.4% sensitivity in a
previous report.
<sup>7</sup>
Reflex methylation testing are performed
separately for samples with premutation and/or full mutation.</p>

<p>Thorough interpretation of results is dependent on the
indication for testing and relies on good communication of
clinical information from the ordering provider. CGG repeats
less than 45 are considered normal and are not consistent
with a diagnosis of or risk for fragile X syndrome or any of
the
FMR1-related disorders. Individuals with alleles in the
intermediate range of 45-54 CGG repeats would be expected
to have a normal phenotype but future generations may be
at risk for expansion of the repeat into the premutation or full
mutation ranges. Individuals with premutations of 55-200
repeats generally do not have fragile X syndrome but are at
risk of other
FMR1-associated disorders, POI or FXTAS.
Premutation carrier females may have children with fragile X
syndrome. Full mutations of greater than 200 CGG repeats
are consistent with a diagnosis of fragile X syndrome but are
not associated with increased risk of POI or FXTAS. Methylation studies are ordered as a reflex test for samples with
premutations and/or full mutations. In cases where the test
results are not consistent with the clinical phenotype, additional
testing may be required to assess other mutations in
FMR1
.</p>

<p>Due to the complex issues surrounding fragile X syndrome
and
FMR1-related disorders, documented informed consent
and genetic counseling is recommended for all families undergoing testing.</p>
