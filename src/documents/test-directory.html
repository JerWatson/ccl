<h2>Using the Test Directory</h2>
<p>The goal of our online Test Directory is to allow you to identify the right test for your needs, determine whether it is available through Cleveland Clinic Laboratories and determine the specimen collection requirements.</p>
<p>The Test Directory includes current clinical and interpretation information for each test, as well as coding and billing information. For more in-depth background on the newest tests in our catalog, please see our Technical Briefs.</p>

<h2>How to Search for Test Information</h2>
<p>Use the Test Directory search, located in the upper-right corner of every page, to find information on all of the tests on our extensive test menu.</p>
