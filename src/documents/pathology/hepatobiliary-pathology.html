    <p class="lead">The Hepatopancreaticobiliary (HPB) Pathology Service provides diagnostic histopathology for biopsy and resection specimens from the liver, biliary tree and pancreas. Seven surgical pathologists with specialty expertise in liver, biliary, and pancreas pathology interpret over 12,000 HPB specimens annually and are actively involved in local, national and international research and teaching activities. Specialty interests among the HPB pathologists include viral hepatitis; fatty liver disease; primary biliary diseases; other chronic liver diseases; and hepatic, pancreatic and biliary tumors. They also have expertise in allograft dysfunction after liver and pancreas transplantation and provide comprehensive consultation on these cases. Our pathologists hold joint appointments and work closely with the highly regarded Cleveland Clinic liver transplant program, supporting the diagnostic needs for the some 120 patients undergoing liver transplantation every year. Selected in-house and consult cases are reviewed regularly by the team in departmental consensus conferences and at multidisciplinary conferences. A weekly multidisciplinary liver pathology review conference is held weekly in the department and provides a venue for clinical care, collaboration and education of providers and trainees from pathology, surgery, pharmacy, and gastroenterology and hepatology.</p>
    <p>Our pathologists hold positions in the premier professional organizations in their field and frequently serve as guest lecturers and speakers at national and international pathology meetings and clinical gastrointestinal, hepatic and transplantation conferences. They also publish extensively in leading medical journals and have authored several book chapters in the field.</p>
