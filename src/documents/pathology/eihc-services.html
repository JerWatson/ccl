<p class="lead">Incorporating technological advances in digital imaging (eSlides) enhances research, education, and patient care across the street and around the world. Cleveland Clinic Laboratories in collaboration with Aperio, Inc., now offers secure, web-based review of IHC-stained slides (eSlides) to help optimize clinical workflow for immunohistochemistry (IHC).</p>
<p>Clients have the opportunity to view IHC-stained eSlides on a computer monitor anytime, anywhere, within 24 hours after the blocks or unstained slides arrive at Cleveland Clinic. Cases contain specimen and slide information, as well as controls that are conveniently at your fingertips. Besides allowing rapid review of IHC-stained slides, additional stains can be ordered following an algorithm, eliminating the need to initially order a large number of stains.</p>
