    <p class="lead">Cleveland Clinic Laboratories’ Genitourinary Pathology Consultative Service specializes in a complete genitourinary and adrenal disease management program, including diagnosis of biopsy and resection specimens, evaluation for histological and molecular prognostic markers, and therapeutic response monitoring.</p>

    <h2>Experience and Expertise</h2>
    <p>Our faculty members are among the most experienced in the country in genitourinary and adrenal pathology. Their interests and diagnostic capabilities cover the spectrum of diseases, including the neoplastic and non-neoplastic diseases of the prostate, testis, bladder, ureter, kidney and adrenal gland. Diagnostic accuracy is enhanced by specimen review by a team of pathologists.</p>
    <p>Our service reviews all slides and confirms diagnosis for patients undergoing genitourinary and adrenal surgical procedures at Cleveland Clinic. We also attract consultations from across the United States and internationally. Each year, the genitourinary pathology consultative group provides expert diagnosis and second opinions on more than 5,000 inhouse and referral cases, including the most rare and complex pathology in the field. We also provide pathologic interpretations and perform molecular studies for industry-sponsored genitourinary disease research trials.</p>

    <h2>Recognized for Excellence</h2>
    <p>Our genitourinary pathologists collaborate closely with clinicians in the Cleveland Clinic Glickman Urological Institute and the Taussig Cancer Institute. US News &amp; World Report has rated the Glickman Urological Institute among the top two urology programs in the nation since 2000, among the top five in the country for 17 consecutive years, and No. 1 in the nation in 2012.</p>
    <p>In addition, the Taussig Cancer Institute helped Cleveland Clinic attain No. 6 among the nation’s top cancer hospitals, as rated by US News &amp; World Report in 2012. The expertise of our genitourinary pathologists, who work closely with the clinical urologists and oncologists in diagnosis and treatment planning, plays a significant role in those accomplishments. Our work in pathology is simultaneously enhanced by our access to the renowned clinical expertise at Cleveland Clinic.</p>

    <h2>National and International Reputation</h2>
    <p>Cleveland Clinic genitourinary pathologists have attained leadership positions in the premier professional organizations in the field. They are welcomed as distinguished guest lecturers and speakers at respected conferences around the world, publish extensively in leading medical journals, and have edited genitourinary pathology textbooks.</p>
