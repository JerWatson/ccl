    <p class="lead">Neuropathology specializes in the pathological evaluation and interpretation of patient specimens from the central and peripheral nervous systems and skeletal muscle. The breadth of expertise encompasses neoplastic and non-neoplastic pathology, with special expertise in brain tumors, epilepsy-related conditions and neuromuscular diseases.</p>
    <p>Primary services include the performance of intraoperative consultation (frozen sections), interpretation of biopsy and resection specimens, and evaluation of autopsied tissue. State-of-the-art molecular testing is performed in the evaluation of CNS neoplasms and includes 1p/19q loss of heterozygosity in gliomas, EGFR amplification, p53 mutational analysis and MGMT testing for brain tumors.</p>

    <h2>Experience and Expertise</h2>
    <p>The Section of Neuropathology participates in interdisciplinary patient management conferences and supports the educational efforts of multiple Institutes and departments throughout Cleveland Clinic, including Neurosurgery, the Brain Tumor Institute, Spine Center, Neurology, Rheumatology, Endocrinology (for pituitary lesions), Epilepsy Center and Neuromuscular Center. Members of the section are involved with more than 100 interdisciplinary conferences annually.</p>
    <p>The Section plays important roles in multicenter trials, facilitating institutional participation as well as serving as central pathology reviewers for studies in which the primary investigator is based at Cleveland Clinic.</p>
    <p>In addition to extensive collaborative research efforts, members of the section participate in individual research projects, primarily focusing on tumors, epilepsy and multiple sclerosis.</p>
