    <p class="lead">Pulmonary Pathology offers evaluation of specimens for neoplastic and non-neoplastic lung diseases, with specialized expertise in neoplastic lung disease, occupational lung disease and transplantation pathology. Pathologists on the service utilize molecular biology, immunohistochemistry, and ultrastructural techniques in their diagnostic workups. Ultrastructural and elemental/particle analysis are available for cases of occupational lung disease.</p>
    <p>Research interests among the pulmonary pathologists include lung carcinogenesis, transplantation immunology and pulmonary infections. They have authored and co-authored leading textbooks in pulmonary pathology, presented national courses on a range of topics in pulmonary pathology and are members of leading professional organizations in the field.</p>

    <h2>Experience and Expertise</h2>
    <p>Our faculty members are subspecialty trained in pulmonary pathology with expertise in lung cancer, interstitial lung disease, lung infectious diseases, occupational lung disease and transplantation pathology. They have special interests in idiopathic interstitial pneumonias, sarcoidosis, pulmonary alveolar proteinosis, and berylliosis. The faculty is actively engaged as collaborators in a number of NIH funded research projects and provides pathologic support for a number of multi-institutional clinical trials in interstitial lung disease, lung cancer and lung transplantation. The lung pathologists see over 6000 lung specimens annually from the Cleveland Clinic Heathcare System.</p>

    <h2>Specialized Capabilities</h2>
    <p>In addition to conventional technologies, our laboratory offers a large panel of immunohistochemical studies, electron microscopy studies and molecular pathology studies.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Electron microscopy for immune complex diseases, ciliary diseases and malignant mesotheliomas.</li>
      <li>Immunofluorescence for vasculitic diseases of the lung.</li>
      <li>Molecular studies for:
        <ul>
          <li>EGFR Mutational analysis</li>
          <li>FISH ALK1 Rearrangements</li>
          <li>KRAS mutational analysis</li>
        </ul>
