<p class="lead">Molecular Microbiology, a section of the Department of Pathology, is responsible for the molecular detection and characterization of infectious agents. This area offers PCR-based detection of Group B Streptococcus, Clostridium difficile, and screening for colonization by methicillin-susceptible and methicillin-resistant S. aureus. It also offers genetic probe-based detection of Group A Streptococcus as a confirmatory test for negative rapid Strep tests. </p>
<p>Automated nucleic acid amplification is used for the detection of N. gonorrhoeae and C. trachomatis, where signal amplification is used to detect high-risk HPV subtypes. Mycobacterial isolate identification is achieved by pyrosequencing, with high-resolution melt curve analysis used to differentiate M. chelonae from M. abscessus. TB/Non-tuberculous mycobacterial PCR is available on smear-positive specimens. </p>
<p>Rapid cycle PCR is available for the following respiratory pathogens: Legionella pneumophila, Pneumocystis jirovecii, influenza A/B and respiratory syncytial virus. In addition, a multiplex respiratory viral panel is available. HIV, HBV and HCV viral load testing is performed here, with HCV genotyping available. CMV, BK and EBV viral loads are also assessed in this area. Numerous other assays are in development or being assessed, such as strain typing, Acanthamoeba PCR, and sequence-based identification for bacteria, fungi and mycobacteria using next-generation sequencing.</p>
