<p class="lead">Molecular Hematopathology provides comprehensive molecular testing for patients with benign and malignant disorders of the lymph nodes, peripheral blood, and bone marrow. Our state-of-the-art diagnostic techniques assist in establishing a diagnosis, predicting prognosis, and/or guiding the choice of therapy and monitoring for a range of benign and malignant hemotolymphoid disorders affecting pediatric and adult patients.</p>
<p>Testing performed includes clonality studies for lymphoproliferative disorders, mutational analysis for acute myeloid leukemias, minimal residual disease monitoring and mutation analysis in chronic myeloid leukemia, mutation testing for myeloproliferative neoplasms, and thalassemia/hemoglobinopathy testing. Numerous fluorescence in situ hybridization assays are available to detect molecular cytogenetic abnormalities associated with myeloid and lymphoid neoplasms. Our spectrum of services is designed to be flexible, from performing a single test to full-service consultation depending on the needs of each client and each case.</p>
<p>Results of molecular testing are correlated with the corresponding morphologic findings where appropriate, and an integrated interpretation is provided. Our pathologists also provide expert assistance in test selection and interpretation of unusual findings.</p>
<p>In addition to their excellence in clinical service, faculty have research interests in a wide variety of hematolymphoid disorders. The faculty also participates in a variety of cooperative groups, multinational consortiums, and national level continuing education programs.</p>
