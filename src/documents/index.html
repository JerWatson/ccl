      <div class="modal-body">
        <p>On September 4, 2014 the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) provided a case definition for patients suspected of having contracted Ebola Virus disease (EVD). Early recognition is a key factor in infection control. Cleveland Clinic Laboratories recommends caregivers review the <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/vhf/ebola/hcp/case-definition.html">CDC EVD Case Definition</a>.</p>
        <p><strong>Cleveland Clinic Laboratories does not perform testing to evaluate patient specimens for the Ebola virus.</strong> Specimens from patients being evaluated for EVD should not be sent to Cleveland Clinic Laboratories for any Ebola virus testing or any other kind of routine clinical testing. In the event a patient meets the case definition for EVD, please follow the guidance below:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Caregivers within Cleveland Clinic who suspect a patient may meet the criteria for being diagnosed with EVD should contact the caregiver with the Infectious Disease on-call pager at x23665</li>
          <li>Caregivers in Ohio should contact The Ohio Department of Health 24-hour Ebola Hotline at (866) 800-1404.</li>
          <li>Caregivers outside of Ohio should contact the CDC’s Emergency Operations Center at (770) 488-7100.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>For more information, please see the CDC Health Advisory issued on October 2, 2014. <a href="http://emergency.cdc.gov/han/han00371.asp">Recommendations for Healthcare Personnel and Health Officials</a>.</p>
