Its antithrombotic mechanism is antithrombin-mediated selective inhibition of factor Xa after binding fondaparinux with antithrombin. However, fondaparinux does not inactivate thrombin and has no effect in platelet function or fibrinolysis. The Fondaparinux Activity assay allows the determination of the plasma levels of fondaparinux by measuring its acceleration of inhibition of activated factor X using a chromogenic substrate method using calibration curve calculated with a commercial Arixtra (fondaparanux) calibrator. This assay cannot be used to monitor patients receiving unfractionated or low molecular weight heparins. Fondaparinux has a half life of approximately 17-21 hours in healthy normal individuals, however, it can be prolonged in patients with renal impairment because fondaparinux is mainly eliminated in urine. While patients treated with fondaparinux are not typically monitored, there is clinical need for monitoring and therapeutic assessment in patients with bleeding or thrombotic complications.\n\nIn patients undergoing treatment with fondaparinux sodium injection 2.5 mg, once daily, the peak steady-state plasma concentration is, on average, 0.39 to 0.50 mg/L and is reached approximately 3 hours post-dose. In these patients, the minimum steady-state plasma concentration is 0.14 to 0.19 mg/L.

Following exogenous insulin challenge, insulin secretion (monitored by C-peptide level) is suppressed in normal subjects. In patients with an insulin-secreting tumor or cancer no significant suppression of C-peptide level is found.","url":"test/?ID=2586"},{"title":"C-Reactive Protein","alias":"CRP","lis":"CRP","lfs":"86140","cpt":"86140(x1)","text":"Evaluation of inflammation","url":"test/?ID=2587"},{"title":"C. difficile Culture w/ reflex Cytotoxin Cell Assay","alias":null,"lis":"CDCULT","lfs":"89385","cpt":"87075(x1)","text":"","url":"test/?ID=4889"},{"title":"Clostridium difficile Toxin by PCR","alias":"C. difficile toxin","lis":"CDPCR","lfs":"87885","cpt":"87493(x1)","text":"This test detects Clostridium difficile toxin B gene (tcdB).

The quantitative VWF defects include type 1 (partial deficiency of VWF) and type 3 (complete absence of VWF) in plasma and/or platelets.  The qualitative VWF defects include type 2, which is further classified as 4 subtypes by different pathophysiologic mechanisms.  Accurate laboratory diagnosis and classification of VWD are crucial because the presenting biological activitiy of VWF determines both the hemorrhagic risk and subsequent clinical managment. The collagen binding activity (CBA) assay has been proposed as a supplemental test for VWF activity.  The CBA assay is based on the ability of multimeric forms of VWF to bind collagen and its greatest strength lies in the ability to selectively detect primarily high molecular weight (HMW) forms of VWF, which are known to be most functional and adhesive.  The CBA assay is a useful adjunctive to diagnose VWD, and differentiate VWD with deficiency of HMW multimer forms in type 2A and type 2B from type 1.  It can also differentiate very low levels of VWF in severe type 1 from complete absence of VWF in type 3.

Symptoms of cholera include profuse watery diarrhea and vomiting; the stool may have a characteristic rice water appearance. Dehydration and electrolyte imbalance can result without appropriate diagnosis and treatment. When ingested, another species of Vibrio, V. parahaemolyticus, can cause watery diarrhea often with abdominal cramping, nausea, vomiting, fever and chills.

Compromised renal function significantly decreases the rate of elimination and causes fluconazole to accumulate. Distributioin and elimination are similar in adults, children as young as age 2 months, and in geriatric patients. Fluconazole does not undergo extensive hepatic metabolism. However, fluconazole is a potent inhibitor of CYP2C9, which affects drugs metabolized by this system such as benzodiazepines, cyclosporine, statins, phenytoin, sirolimus, tacrolimus, and warfarin.

Normally, there are fewer than 45 CGG triplet repeats but affected individuals have greater than 200 CGG repeats. These full mutations result in hypermethylation of the promoter region, with subsequest silencing of gene expression and absence of the FMR1 protein (FMRP). Alleles with 55 to 200 CGG repeats are considered premutations; they do not cause fragile X syndrome but are prone to meiotic instability and may expand to full mutations in one generation. 20% of women with premutations experience premature ovarian insufficiency (POI), with onset of menopause before the age of 40.

HSV can infect neonates, children and adults. HSV is transmitted primarily by direct contact with infected secretions from symptomatic or an asymptomatic person. Lesions on the skin and mucous membranes of the mouth and genitals characterize most HSV positive cases. HSV infection can be either primary (>90% of these cases are asymptomatic) or recurrent (secondary). Primary infection with HSV-1 can lead to, among others, gingivostomatitis, eczema herpeticum, keratoconjunctivitis and encephalitis. Primary infection with HSV-2 occurs as, among others, vulvovaginitis, meningitis and generalized herpes in newborns. The primary symptoms of a secondary infection are skin lesions in the nose, mouth and genital regions. Even more severe are the recurrent forms of keratoconjunctivitis and meningitis. Although HSV is responsible for 5-10% of all cases of acute viral encephalitis in the US, it is the most common cause of severe sporadic encephalitis. HSV-1 and HSV-2 can cause encephalitis in neonates, most cases of HSV encephalitis in older children are the results of HSV-1 infection. The detection of HSV DNA in the CSF of patients with suspected HSV encephalitis allows a rapid and non-invasive confirmation of the diagnosis. A negative test result does not exclude disease. Clinical history, symptoms and findings are necessary since HSV DNA may not be detectable in early acute stages and DNA levels fall over time.","url":"test/?ID=3009"},{"title":"HSV 1,2  Antibodies, IgG and IgM","alias":"HSV Antibodies; HerpeSelect","lis":"HSVGM","lfs":"89293","cpt":"86694(x1); 86695(x1); 86696(x1)","text":"","url":"test/?ID=4741"},{"title":"Herpesvirus 6 Human IgG & IgM Abs","alias":null,"lis":"HV6ABS","lfs":"83017","cpt":"86790(x2)","text":"Aid in the diagnosis of post infection/exposure to roseola infantum; may be useful in the diagnosis of chronic fatigue syndrome.","url":"test/?ID=3014"},{"title":"Herpesvirus 6 IgG Ab","alias":"HHV-6 Antibody IgG","lis":"HHV6","lfs":"76519","cpt":"86790(x1)","text":"Aid in the diagnosis of post infection/exposure to roseola infantum; may be useful in the diagnosis of chronic fatigue syndrome.","url":"test/?ID=3015"},{"title":"Herpesvirus 6 IgM Antibodies, CSF","alias":"HHV-6 IgM Abs CSF","lis":"CHHV6M","lfs":"81734","cpt":"86790(x1)","text":"","url":"test/?ID=3016"},{"title":"Herpesvirus 6 IgM Antibody","alias":"HHV-6 IgM Ab","lis":"HHV6M","lfs":"81735","cpt":"86790(x1)","text":"","url":"test/?ID=3017"},{"title":"Herpesvirus 6 PCR, Quant","alias":null,"lis":"HV6QNT","lfs":"84312","cpt":"87533(x1)","text":"Fecal specimens will be reported as Detected/Not Detected.

Following vaccination, an antibody ratio of less than twofold is considered a non-responder; a ratio of two- to fourfold is a weak responder; a ratio of fourfold or greater is a good responder. The higher the pre-vaccination antibody for a specific pneumococcal serotype, the less likely the response will increase significantly after vaccination. An increased antibody level to 50 - 70% or more of the serotypes is thought to represent a normal humoral response. In the case of pure polysaccharide vaccine, indication of immune system competence is further delineated as an adequate response to at least 70% of the serotypes in the vaccine challenge for those 6 - 65 years of age, or to at least 50% of the serotypes in the vaccine challenge for those 2 - 5 years of age.\n","url":"test/?ID=4875"},{"title":"Huntington's Disease","alias":null,"lis":"HUNTDI","lfs":"81571","cpt":"81401(x1)","text":"","url":"test/?ID=3070"},{"title":"Streptozyme","alias":"Streptococcus Pyogenes, Group A Abs; Hyalurnoidase Antibody","lis":"STRPTO","lfs":"79194","cpt":"86403(x1)","text":"","url":"test/?ID=3729"},{"title":"Hydrocodone, Serum","alias":"Hycodan; Vicodin","lis":"HYDSER","lfs":"88457","cpt":"82542(x1)","text":"Trough levels are most reproducible.","url":"test/?ID=4552"},{"title":"Hypercholesterolemia (LDLR) Evaluation","alias":null,"lis":"LDLR","lfs":"83322","cpt":"81406(x1)","text":"Elevated plasma cholesterol levels; Family history of premature coronary heart disease; Family history of Familial Hypercholesterolemia.","url":"test/?ID=3073"},{"title":"Hypercoagulation Diagnostic Interpretive Panel","alias":"Hypercoagulation Panel","lis":"HYPER","lfs":"173","cpt":"81240(x1); 83090(x1); 85240(x1); 85300(x1); 85303(x1); 85306(x1); 85307(x1); 85384(x1); 85390(x1); 85610(x1); 85730(x1); 85730(x1); 85732(x1); 86140(x1); 86147(x3)","text":"Use in the evaluation of congenital or acquired disorders associated with a hypercoagulable state.","url":"test/?ID=3074"},{"title":"Hyperoxaluria, Urine","alias":null,"lis":"UHYPER","lfs":"87816","cpt":"82544(x1)","text":"Increased concentrations of oxalate and glycolate indicate type 1 hyperoxaluria.

The fact that elevated leptin levels fail to alter the obese state of these individuals may be related to a 'leptin resistance' and an inability of leptin to enter the cerebral spinal fluid to reach sites in the hypothalamus to regulate appetite. Leptin levels have been shown to change under certain endocrine conditions. For example, when leptin levels are expressed per body adiposity, females have higher leptin levels than do males. This may be related to the distribution of adipose tissue where omental fat vs. subcutaneous fat, which differs between genders, may have different leptin production rates.

Immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) is a destructive thrombocytopenia caused by autoantibodies. Neonatal alloimmune thrombocytopenia (NATP) and post-transfusion purpura (PTP) are diseases where thrombocytopenia is caused by platelet-specific alloantibodies. HLA alloantibodies do not cause thrombocytopenia, but are commonly associated with refractoriness to platelet transfusions.

Non fasting serum samples are often compromised by significant analytic interferences.","url":"test/?ID=3909"},{"title":"Y-Chromosome Microdeletion","alias":null,"lis":"YCMICR","lfs":"81417","cpt":"81403(x1)","text":"Tests for microdeletions in the AZFa, AZFb and AZFc regions of the Y Chromosome.","url":"test/?ID=3911"},{"title":"Zinc, Urine 24 Hour","alias":null,"lis":"UZINCD","lfs":"84635","cpt":"84630(x1)","text":"Zinc Toxicity","url":"test/?ID=3916"},{"title":"Zinc, Urine Random","alias":null,"lis":"UZINCR","lfs":"77601","cpt":"84630(x1)","text":"Zinc Toxicity","url":"test/?ID=3915"},{"title":"Zinc, Whole Blood","alias":null,"lis":"ZINCWB","lfs":"89781","cpt":"84630(x1)","text":"","url":"test/?ID=4982"},{"title":"Zonisamide","alias":"Zonegran","lis":"ZONIS","lfs":"82419","cpt":"80203(x1)","text":"","url":"test/?ID=3917"}],"pdfs":[{"title":"2013-01.pdf","text":"Cleveland Clinic Laboratories Technical Update • January 2013 Cleveland Clinic Laboratories is dedicated to keeping you updated and informed about recent testing changes.

The second blood culture can be drawn immediately after the first is drawn, provided the two blood cultures are collected separately, i.e. from different sites/arms. If the same arm must be used, collect the second culture 30 minutes after the first. A maximum of four blood culture sets is permitted in a 24 hour period. Patient Skin Preparation: Select vein, swab with ChloraPrep Sepp (2% chlorhexidine gluconate with 70% alcohol applicator). Saturate the applicator tip by gently pressing it against the skin, apply the solution in a back and forth motion for 30 seconds, completely wetting the area. Allow the prepped area to dry completely. Do not repalpate the vein. If the venipuncture is unsuccessful, re-prep the vein as above. Venipuncture and Inoculation: Perform venipuncture using a sterile syringe (20 mL for adults, 1-20 mL for children depending on weight of the patient). Wipe the rubber stopper of each blood culture bottle with a new ChloraPrep. Saturate the applicator tip by gently pressing it against the stopper, apply the solution in concentric circles, completely wetting the stopper; allow the prepped area to dry completely. Always inoculate the aerobic bottle first; optimal volume is 10 mL/bottle. Do not overfill. Invert all tubes/bottles several times to ensure thorough mixture. Label the blood culture bottle with the collect date and time, collection site, set #1 or set #2, initials of individual drawing the blood, patient’s name and patient medical record number.

Transport in original collection tube; Ambient 5/2/2013 Chlamydia trachomatis DFA CHLDFA 79195 Special Information: 1. Specimens should be collected early in the acute phase of infection. The chance of microorganism recovery is best during the first 3 days after onset and is greatly reduced beyond 5 days with many microorganisms. 2. Two prepared slides or smears can be submitted. Fix with methanol. Place in slide holder. Ship at ambient temperature. 3. Acceptable specimens: Urethral, cervical, rectal mucosal, eye, and nasopharyngeal specimens. For infants, submit nasopharyngeal aspirate, washings, or a swab. Place specimens immediately in UTM or Chlamydia transport media. 4. To maintain optimum viability, place swab or fluid into UTM or equivalent Chlamydia transport medium and send to Cleveland Clinic Laboratories ASAP. Best recovery is obtained when the specimens are refrigerated at 2-8°C or kept on wet ice following collection and while in transit. If there will be a long delay before processing, specimens in UTM or equivalent should be frozen at -70°C or colder and transported frozen. Storage or transport at -20°C is not acceptable. 5. Unacceptable specimens: Urine, wooden shaft or calcium alginate swabs, dry swabs. Swabs in bacterial gel-based transport media, swabs in nucleic acid transport media, tissues in fixatives, broken slides. 6. The specimen source is essential because processing and set up is dependent on it and therefore the specimen source is required. 3/12/2013 Circulating Tumor Cells CTC 82886 CPT: 86152 4/25/2013 Cobalt, Serum COBALT 83022 Specimen Requirement: 2 mL serum from a no additive navy blue top tube; Do not use serum separator tubes; Remove serum from cells ASAP and aliquot into a trace metal free transport tube (ARUP #43116); Transport tubes are available by calling Client Services at 800.628.6816 or 216.444.5755; Ambient 4/25/2013 Copper, Serum Free (Direct) FRCOP 84316 Specimen Requirement: 2.5 mL serum from a no additive navy blue top tube; Do not use serum separator tubes; Remove serum from cells ASAP and aliquot into a trace metal free transport tube (ARUP #43116); Transport tubes are available by calling Client Services at 800.628.6816 or 216.444.5755; Frozen 4/25/2013 Days Performed: Tuesday, Thursday, Saturday Reported: 2 - 5 days Everolimus EVERO 88194 Reference Range: 3.0 - 8.0 ng/mL Urgent Range: > 30.0 ng/mL Critical Range: > 15.0 ng/mL 4/1/2013 Fungitell Assay for (1,3)-ß-D-Glucan BDGLUC 88499 Days Performed: Monday - Friday 4/1/2013 HLA B5701 B5701 84337 Methodology: Qualitative Allele-specific Real Time Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) 3/20/2013 Immune Function Assay ATP IMMFUN 82662 Specimen Requirement: 3 mL whole blood in a sodium heparin green top tube; Specimen MUST be received at Cleveland Clinic Laboratories by 12:00 noon on Friday; Critical Ambient 4/15/2013 Reported: 3 - 7 days Reference Range: 225 - 525 ng/mL Low response: ≤ 225 ng/mL Moderate Response: 226 - 524 ng/mL Strong Response: ≥ 525 ng/mL Days Performed: Monday - Saturday Reported: 2 - 3 days CPT: 86352 9500 Euclid Avenue | Cleveland, Ohio 44195 | 216.444.5755 | 800.628.6816 | clevelandcliniclabs.com 4 Test Changes (cont.)

Test Name Order Code Billing Code Change Effective Date Cadmium Exposure Panel OSHA CADEXR 81903 Special Information: Blood cadmium levels can be used to monitor acute toxicity and in combination with cadmium urine and ß-2 Microglobulin is the preferred method for monitoring occupational exposure. Symptoms associated with cadmium toxicity vary based upon route of exposure and may include tubular proteinuria, fever, headache, dyspnea, chest pain, conjunctivitis, rhinitis, sore throat and cough. Ingestion of cadmium in high concentration may cause vomiting, diarrhea, salivation, cramps, and abdominal pain. Urine cadmium levels can be used to assess cadmium body burden. In chronic exposures, the kidneys are the primary target organ. Urine ß-2 Microglobulin is an early marker of irreversible kidney damage and disease. Urine creatinine values less than 20 mg/dL represent very dilute urine and collections should be repeated. OSHA Action Levels: Cadmium, Urine (ug/g crt): level A: 0 - 3; level B: 3.1 - 7.0; level C: ≥ 7.1 Cadmium, Blood (ug/L): level A: 0 - 5; level B: 5.1 - 10.0; level C: ≥ 10.1 ß-2-Microglobulin, Urine (ug/g crt): level A: 0 - 300; level B: 301 - 750; level C: ≥ 751 MONITOR: level A: Annual; level B: Semiannual; level C: Quarterly MEDICAL EXAM: level A: Biennial; level B: Annual; level C: Semiannual Reassess cadmium exposure in less than two weeks: level A: not applicable; level B: Discretionary removal; level C: Mandatory removal If an employee's ß-2 Microglobulin level is above 750 µg/g CRT, in order for mandatory medical removal to be required, either the employee's Cd urine level must also be above 3 µg/g CRT or Cd blood level must also be above 5 µg/L. The determination of discretionary or mandatory removal is made by the examining physician consistent with the medical surveillance specifications in the Federal Register 42456 to 42463. 8/19/2013 Includes: Cadmium Blood (µg/L) Cadmium, Urine per volume (µg/L) Cadmium Urine, ratio to Creatinine (µg/g CRT) ß-2 Microglobulin, Urine (µg/L) ß-2 Microglobulin, ratio to Creatinine (µg/g CRT) Creatinine, Urine per volume (mg/dL) pH, Urine Test build may need to be modified Reference Range: Cadmium Blood: 0.0 - 5.0 µg/L Cadmium, Urine per volume: 0.0 - 2.6 µg/L Cadmium Urine, ratio to Creatinine: 0.0 - 3.0 µg/g CRT ß-2 Microglobulin, Urine: 1 - 160 µg/L ß-2 Microglobulin, ratio to Creatinine: 0 - 300 µg/g CRT Creatinine, Urine per volume: Not established CMV by PCR, CSF/Fluid/Tissue CMVCSF 79779 Test Name: Previously CMV Detection, CSF/Fluid by PCR 8/15/2013 9500 Euclid Avenue | Cleveland, Ohio 44195 | 216.444.5755 | 800.628.6816 | clevelandcliniclabs.com 6 Test Changes (cont.)

For specimens with a total arsenic concentration between 35 - 2,000 µg/L, fractionation is performed at an additional cost to determine the proportion of the inorganic, methylated, and organic forms. Inorganic forms of arsenic are most toxic. Methylated forms arise primarily from metabolism of inorganic forms but may also come from dietary sources and are of moderate toxic potential. The organic forms of arsenic are considered nontoxic and arise primarily from food. The sum of the inorganic, methylated, and organic forms of arsenic may be lower than the total arsenic level. If low-level chronic poisoning is suspected, the µg/gCRT ratio may be more sensitive than the total arsenic concentration. It may be appropriate to fractionate specimens with a µg/gCRT ratio > 30 despite a total arsenic concentration < 35 µg/L; the laboratory will perform upon request. 9/19/2013 Chromosomal Microarray SNP, Constitutional CRMSNP 89612 Special Information: FISH to confirm CRMSNP will be added by Cytogeneticist when required for the completion of the Chromosomal Microarray test. Days performed excludes Cleveland Clinic observed holidays. Specimens are processed as soon as appropriate FISH probe(s) are received from the vendor. Patient will be charged based on the number of confirmatory probes performed.

Test Name Order Code Billing Code Test Information Effective Date Rivaroxiban RVXBAN 89645 Special Information: Research Use Only. Rivaroxiban (Bayer Pharma AG, Germany) is a highly selective direct factor Xa inhibitor with oral bioavailability. Rivaroxiban binds directly to the catalytic site of the serine protease factor Xa, independently of antithrombin, and inhibits both free and prothrombinase-bound factor Xa. It is indicated to prevent and treat thromboembolic disorders such as ischemic stroke, systemic embolism or nonvalvular atrial fibrillation. It also reduces the risk of recurrence of deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism in patients receiving orthopedic surgery. Rivaroxiban can provide more consistent and predictable anticoagulation than other anticoagulants such as Warfarin. Routine laboratory monitoring for Rivaroxiban is not necessary. However, Rivaroxiban measurement will be necessary in patients suspicious of poor compliance or failure of therapy, patients who require potential dose adjustment or patients with hepatic/renal dysfunction. As a direct factor Xa inhibitor, clotting times of coagulation tests downstream from factor Xa including PT and APTT will be prolonged. Rivaroxiban will be measured by chromogenic anti-Xa assay using specific STA- Rivaroxiban in STA-R Evolution Coagulometer. 9/26/2013 Specimen Requirement: 2 mL plasma from a sodium citrate light blue top tube; Frozen Methodology: Chromogenic Reference Range: Dosage 20 mg qD: Peak (2 - 4 hours post dose): 215 (22 - 535 µg/L) Trough (24 hours post dose): 32 (6 - 329 µg/L) 15 mg qD: Peak (2 - 4 hours post dose): 215 ( 22 - 535 µg/L) Trough (24 hours post dose): 32 (6 - 329 µg/L) 10 mg qD: Peak (2 - 4 hours post dose): 101 (7 - 273 µg/L) Trough (24 hours post dose): 14 ( 4 - 51 µg/L) Days Performed: Sunday - Saturday Reported: 4 hours CPT: 80299 Price: $238.00 SCA1 DNA Test SCA1 89657 Specimen Requirement: 20 mL whole blood in EDTA lavender top tubes; Collect Monday - Wednesday only; Send to Cleveland Clinic Laboratories on the day of collection; Ambient 10/10/2013 Methodology: Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) Fragment Analysis by Capillary Electrophoresis Reference Range: ≤ 35 CAG trinucleotide repeats Days Performed: Monday - Friday Reported: 8 - 15 days CPT: 81479 Price: $470.00 (non-discountable) SCA2 Expansion Analysis SCA2 89650 Special Information: Phase 1 testing is for SCA2 expansions with CAG repeat sizes that are determined using PCR and capillary electrophoresis fragment analysis.

Cleveland Clinic Laboratories is making a change in the reporting of Mycobacterial species of which we wanted to make you aware. Currently, clients are notified by telephone when an AFB culture is positive by either direct smear, or when there is growth on laboratory media. A second notification is made when the final species identification is determined. With the exception of identification of M. tuberculosis, we will be discontinuing telephone notification of the final species name. We will continue to notify you when the culture is initially positive. Beginning October 14th, the following comment will be included with the initial, positive culture result: “Please consult medical record for mycobacterial species. Identification testing is performed weekly.” When we result the final identification of species other than M. tuberculosis e.g. MAI, or M. abscessus we will include this comment: “Susceptibility testing is not routinely performed. Please contact Microbiology (216.444.9573) within 4 weeks if susceptibility testing is clinically indicated.\" All isolates will be saved on solid media for a month, but at least one isolate per patient will be stored in the freezer for several years.

Any other transport system is unacceptable. Specimens must be received within 72 hours of collection. Vaginal specimens are the only acceptable specimen type. This test is used for women with symptoms of vaginitis. Other tests for the evaluation of vaginitis are available on vaginal fluid or vaginal swab specimens. If only bacterial vaginosis is suspected, then the Bacterial Vaginosis Scored Gram Stain (BVSTN) should be ordered. If only candidiasis is suspected, then the Vaginal Smear for Candida (CANSTN) should be ordered. The diagnosis of trichomoniasis is challenging in the traditional wet mount relies on the mobility of the parasite, which is lost during transport. Wet mount preparations are not acceptable if the transport time exceeds 6 hours; optimal transport time is less than 1 hour. If trichomoniasis is suspected then the OSOM Trichomonas Rapid test (TRICHO) should be ordered. It should be noted that molecular diagnostic methods have significantly higher cost to patient charges than other methods. If a vaginal specimen is submitted in a BD Affirm VPIII collection tube, the Vaginal Pathogens DNA Direct Probe test (VAGDNA) will be performed. 1/16/2014 von Willebrand Type 2N Sequence Analysis TYPE2N 82906 Days Performed: Monday - Friday 1/9/2014 Reported: 3 - 4 weeks CPT: 81405 9500 Euclid Avenue | Cleveland, Ohio 44195 | 216.444.5755 | 800.628.6816 | clevelandcliniclabs.com 4 New Tests Test Name Order Code Billing Code Test Information Effective Date Arbovirus Antibodies, IgG and IgM, CSF ARCSF 89763 Includes: St. Louis Encephalitis Antibody, IgG California Encephalitis Antibody, IgG Eastern Equine Encephalitis Antibody, IgG Western Equine Encephalitis Antibody, IgG West Nile Virus Antibody, IgG St. Louis Encephalitis Antibody, IgM California Encephalitis Antibody, IgM Eastern Equine Encephalitis Antibody, IgM Western Equine Encephalitis Antibody, IgM West Nile Virus Antibody, IgM 12/19/2013 Specimen Requirement: 4 mL cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in a sterile container; Frozen Methodology: Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) Semi-quantitative Indirect Fluorescent Antibody (IFA) Reference Range: St. Louis Encephalitis Antibody, IgG: < 1:1 California Encephalitis Antibody, IgG: < 1:1 Eastern Equine Encephalitis Antibody, IgG: < 1:1 Western Equine Encephalitis Antibody, IgG: < 1:1 West Nile Virus Antibody, IgG: ≤ 1.29 IV: Negative 1.30 - 1 ​ .49 IV: Equivocal ≥ 1.50 IV: Positive St. Louis Encephalitis Antibody, IgM: < 1:1 California Encephalitis Antibody, IgM: < 1:1 Eastern Equine Encephalitis Antibody, IgM: < 1:1 Western Equine Encephalitis Antibody, IgM: < 1:1 West Nile Virus Antibody, IgM: ≤ 0.89 IV: Negative 0.90 - 1 ​ .10 IV: Equivocal ≥ 1.11 IV: Positive Days Performed: Tuesday, Friday Reported: 2 - 6 days CPT: 86651x2, 86652x2, 86653x2, 86654x2, 86789, 86788 Price: $488.00 (non-discountable) Bacterial Vaginosis Scored Gram Stain BVSTN 89767 Special Information: Determination of a score for the relative amounts of microbial morphologies observed in a Gram Stain of vaginal fluid is the definitive method for diagnosing bacterial vaginosis.

Test Name Order Code Billing Code Change Effective Date Clozapine CLOZ 87714 Special Information: A therapeutic range has not been established; however, a clozapine level of 100 ng/mL is suggested as the minimum therapeutic threshold. Data suggests that concentrations between 100 and 700 ng/mL correlate more with response; however, non-response does occur within this range. For refractory schizophrenia, at least 350 ng/mL of clozapine is suggested to achieve a therapeutic response. After initial therapeutic response occurs, the dose should be progressively reduced to the minimum level necessary to maintain clinical remission. The likelihood of seizures and other side effects increase with clozapine levels greater than 1200 ng/mL and/or dosages greater than 600 mg/d.

Methodology: Stain Clinical Information: Neutrophils are polymorphonuclear lymphocytes that provide effective host defense against bacterial and fungal infections. Individuals with marked decrease of neutrophils or severe defects in neutrophil functions often suffer from recurrent systemic bacterial infections (i.e. pneumonia). Membrane sensors (receptors) from neutrophils can detect minute amount of microbial products together with endogenous chemoattractants, complements and cytokines during infection. These molecules act to recruit neutrophils to the site of infection. Neutrophils will engage in a series of physical and chemical process that result in the sequestration and lysis of microorganisms. The Nitroblue Tetrazolium Reduction Assay (NBT) is a qualitative assay of Oxidative metabolism which requires the integrity of phagocytosis and oxidative metabolism. In the NBT assay, neutrophils phagocytize endotoxin and nitroblue tetrazolium, and reduces the NBT to blue formazan in the presence of intact oxidative metabolism. NBT reduction is a useful means of assaying overall metabolic integrity of phagocytizing neutrophils.

Tomsich Pathology & Laboratory Medicine will begin reporting Her2 status in breast carcinoma according to new guidelines from The American Society of Clinical Oncology/College of American Pathologists (ASCO/CAP)(1). The ASCO/CAP states that Her2 status must be determined in all patients with invasive breast cancer. Additionally, the guidelines for both interpretation of the immunohistochemical and fluorescence in situ hybridization testing have modified the cutoff values for negative, positive and equivocal results. Other changes include modification of the pre-analytic variables guidelines such as recommended length of fixation.

Patients with gram positive bacteremia, may have lowered assay specificity. Patients with renal failure on hemodialysis utilizing cellulose membranes may have false positive results. Patients require 3 - 4 days for the restoration of baseline levels of serum (1,3)-ß-D-glucan after being treated with fractionated blood products such as albumin and immunoglobulin and being exposed to glucan-containing gauze. Heel or finger stick samples are unacceptable because of the alcohol soaked gauze used to prepare the site. The performance of this assay has not been evaluated with specimens from neonates and infants < 6 months of age. Patients whose GI tract is colonized with Candida and have mucositis may have a positive result without invasive fungal disease. 6/17/2014 Specimen Requirement: 0.5 mL serum from a serum separator tube; Remove serum from cells within 2 hours of collection; Minimum: 0.2 mL; Frozen Methodology: Limulus Amebocyte Lysate (LAL) Pathway Days Performed: Monday - Saturday Reported: 2 - 4 days Helicobacter pylori Antigen, Stool SHPYLR 82624 Specimen Requirement: 5 g stool in a preservative free, sterile container; Minimum: 1 g; Within 2 hours of collection, transfer 5 g stool into an ARUP (#40910) transport vial.

Aminolevulinic acid (ALA) dehydratase (ALAD) deficiency porphyria (ADP) results from a deficiency of ALAD, which causes ALA accumulation with subsequent excretion in the urine. Urinary porphobilinogen (PBG) remains essentially normal, which rules out other forms of acute porphyria. ADP is an autosomal recessive, acute hepatic porphyria that produces neurologic symptoms similar to those seen in acute intermittent porphyria. Symptoms include acute abdominal pain, peripheral neuropathy, nausea, vomiting, constipation, and diarrhea. Respiratory impairment, seizures, and psychosis are possible during an acute period. ADP is extremely rare with only 7 cases described in the literature since 1979. 9/30/2014 Specimen Requirement: Whole blood Sodium heparin (Green). Place specimen on ice after draw.

Patients on prednisone should be off medication for 2 weeks prior to draw. Clinical Information: Chronic urticaria (CU) is a common and complex dermatological condition that is suspected when patients experience persistent hives for over 6 weeks. No published evidence of an exogenous allergen as the cause of this disorder exists. About 45 percent of cases have autoantibodies directed against either basophil or mast cell-associated IgE or the high affinity IgE-Fc receptor (Fc epsilon R1 alpha). The presence of histamine releasing factors (including but not limited to IgE and Fc epsilon R1 alpha-specific autoantibodies) in the patient serum can be indirectly determined by evaluating basophil/mast cell activation status using histamine release assays, autologous serum-skin test, and flow cytometric measurement of the basophil and mast cell-specific marker CD203c. Serum from CU patients can activate donor basophils, which induces histamine release and CD203c upregulation.

Chromosomal microarray analysis (CMA) is a recommended first-tier test for diagnosing unexplained intellectual disabilities, dysmorphic features, congenital anomalies and autism.1-5 This technique compares relative fluorescent signal intensities of two different genomes, a test and a reference, that compete for hybridization to DNA sequences representing the whole human genome in order to detect a gain or loss of genetic material. However, CMA does not detect allelic imbalances resulting in absence of heterozygosity (AOH). Advances in the field of genetics and diagnostic medicine have resulted in refinement of the existing CMA platform by incorporating single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers to the existing non-polymorphic markers used to detect gains and losses of DNA. The analysis of SNP data provides information about the allelic imbalances associated with AOH. Identifying regions of excessive homozygosity on a single chromosome could suggest uniparental disomy (UPD), which may warrant further clinical and laboratory investigation when observed on chromosomes with known imprinting disorders associated with UPD. In addition, the detection of excessive homozygosity on multiple chromosomes may suggest consanguinity and, therefore, could be useful in determining candidate genes for further testing for autosomal recessive disorders. The Agilent array is comprised of 107,000 oligonucleotide 60mer probes spaced one probe every 40kb across the backbone of the array and one probe every 10kb in targeted clinically significant regions in the genome. For SNP analysis, the array features 60,000 SNP 60mer probes with an effective resolution down to 10Mb. Data for the SNP markers are displayed to demonstrate either homozygosity (AA or BB) or heterozygosity (AB) at every SNP locus. AOH is indicative of hemizygosity if the corresponding CMA data shows a deletion of the region. If the CMA data is normal, AOH signifies homozygosity. Clinical Indications In the pediatric population many abnormal phenotypes are associated with chromosomal imbalances that can be identified using CMA to detect copy number change (CNC). Thus, whole-genome CMA has replaced chromosome and FISH studies to become the first-tier test for the evaluation of children with unexplained developmental disabilities, intellectual disabilities, dysmorphic features, congenital anomalies and autism. Based on numerous published studies, the yield of pathogenic or clinically significant CNC by CMA is approximately 15-20% in a pediatric population, compared with a yield of 3-5% by standard cytogenetic analysis in the same population. Variants of uncertain clinical significance (VOUS), or clinical significance unknown, are found in less than 10% and could play an important role in the clinical diagnosis. To a great extent, parental and family studies can be helpful in the clinical interpretation of these unknowns, as de novo occurrence of the CNC is more likely related to a pathogenic event. 9500 Euclid Avenue | Cleveland, Ohio 44195 | 216.444.5755 | 800.628.6816 | clevelandcliniclabs.com CMA testing for CNC is recommended as a first-line test in the initial postnatal evaluation of individuals with the following: • multiple anomalies not specific to a well-delineated genetic syndrome SNP testing may be used to identify: • a chromosomal abnormality or micro-duplication/deletion syndrome with a normal karyotype • apparently nonsyndromic DD/ID • the size of a duplication/deletion involved in an unbalanced translocation • autism spectrum disorders • triploidy This is not a recommended test for adult patients with multiple miscarriages or pregnancy losses and no abnormal phenotype. Chromosome analysis is a better test to exclude possibility of balanced rearrangements that cause pregnancy losses. • cryptic duplications/deletions in a phenotypically abnormal individual with an apparently balanced karyotype Appropriate follow up is recommended in cases of chromosome imbalance identified by CMA and may include cytogenetic/FISH or other molecular studies of the patient or parents, and clinical genetics consultation. In addition to detecting CNC, the SNP microarray can also be used to diagnose suspected uniparental disomy (UPD) or imprinting disorder, possible absence of heterozygosity to determine the degree of relatedness by identity-by-descent (autozygosity) and autosomal recessive condition risks. Additional testing may be necessary to confirm disorders associated with absence of heterozygosity. • uniparental disomy (UPD) • absence of heterozygosity to determine the degree of relatedness by identity-by-descent (autozygosity) Methodology The SNP test involves DNA extraction, restriction enzyme digestion, labeling, purification, hybridization, washing, array scanning, analysis and interpretation. DNA extracted from the patient’s peripheral blood is digested, labeled and hybridized to the microarray. Following hybridization, the microarray is scanned, and the signal intensities are collected then compared to a reference in order to determine copy number changes and absence of heterozygosity. Whole genome SNP microarray testing at Cleveland Clinic utilizes the GGXChip + SNP v1.0 platform, which contains non-polymorphic and polymorphic probes to detect both copy number changes (CNC) and allelic imbalances (SNP probes) within the same array. For CNC analysis, the array is comprised of 107,000 oligonucleotide 60mer probes spaced one probe every 40kb across the backbone of the array and one probe every 10kb in targeted clinically significant regions in the genome. For SNP analysis, the array features 60,000 SNP 60mer probes with an effective resolution down to 10Mb. In the backbone regions the resolution for copy number detection is approximately 120kb and in the targeted regions it is approximately 30kb. In our validation the resolution for AOH was detected at approximately 1.5Mb, but resolution is dependent on SNP probe coverage. For clinical purposes, AOH greater than 10Mb will be reported; however, in chromosomes associated with imprinting disorders, smaller changes will be evaluated further and may be reported. For a complete list of clinically recognized regions of the genome and imprinted chromosomes please visit www. signaturegenomics.com.6 There are some limitations to this platform. It is not optimized to detect low-level mosaicism and uniparental disomy of the heterodisomy type. It will not detect balanced alterations (reciprocal translocations, Robertsonian translocations, inversions, and balanced insertions), point mutations or imbalances of regions not represented on the microarray. Interpretation A written summary of the microarray test is provided in the Test Overview. Gains and losses are reported based on genomic content in line with ACMG guidelines for microarray interpretation. Copy number variations (CNV) or CNC devoid of relevant gene content or reported as common findings in the general population may not be reported. A copy number change of uncertain clinical significance may be detected and will be reported per ACMG guidelines in one of three subcategories: uncertain clinical significance, likely pathogenic; uncertain clinical significance, likely benign; or uncertain clinical significance, no classification.3 While most copy number changes observed by chromosomal microarray testing can readily be characterized as pathogenic or benign, there are limited data available to support definitive classification of a subset into either of these categories. In these situations, a number of considerations are taken into account to help interpret results including the size and gene content of the imbalance, whether the change is a deletion or duplication, the inheritance pattern, and the clinical and/or developmental history of a transmitting parent. The continual discovery of novel copy number variations and published clinical reports means that the interpretation of any given copy number change may evolve with increased scientific understanding. The detection of excessive homozygosity may suggest the need for additional laboratory testing to confirm uniparental disomy or to test for mutations in genes associated with autosomal recessive disorders consistent with the patient’s clinical presentation that are present in regions of homozygosity. Uniparental disomy: Uniparental disomy (UPD), the presence of two copies of a chromosome or chromosomal region from a single parent, is clinically relevant when it involves loci that undergo genomic imprinting. There are two types of UPD: isodisomy, in which the two parental copies are identical; and heterodisomy, in which the parental copies are derived from both parental homologs and are therefore not identical. SNP microarrays will detect isodisomy but not heterodisomy, since only isodisomy or segmental isodisomy results in homozygosity. UPD is the most likely explanation for an absence of heterozygosity that is restricted to a single chromosome, especially if the region is very large. Several chromosome regions are imprinted and lead to an abnormal phenotype in the presence of UPD derived from a particular parent (Figure 1). UPD in other regions of the genome, even if covering a large region, is generally not considered to be a pathogenic finding in and of itself (see recessive disease discussion below). Figure 1. Uniparental disomy 15 A: CMA Data, Agilent Array B: SNP Data, Agilent Array CGH showed normal copy number (1a); however AOH was noted for chromosome 15 (UPD15) (1b) and was confirmed by methylation studies. This patient has been diagnosed with Angelman syndrome. Identity by Descent (IBD) and Consanguinity: The observation of multiple AOH regions, also known as long continuous stretches of homozygosity (LCSH), present on multiple chromosomes is generally assumed to reflect inheritance of these regions by descent from a common ancestor. This type of homozygosity is referred to as “identity by descent.” A single or a few small isolated stretches can be the result of a founder effect in an isolated population. Presence of especially long stretches on multiple chromosomes suggests the possibility of a more direct biological relationship between the parents (i.e., parental consanguinity) (Figure 2). A consanguineous relationship refers to the sharing of a common ancestor and the term consanguinity is generally used when individuals are second cousins or closer. Figure 2. Full Genome Profile Chromosome 10 Chromosome 1 Chromosome 11 Chromosome 2 Chromosome 13 Chromosome 3 Chromosome 14 Chromosome 4 Chromosome 16 Chromosome 5 Chromosome 17 Chromosome 6 Chromosome 18 Chromosome 7 Chromosome 21 Chromosome 8 Chromosome 22 Chromosome 9 Multiple AOH regions were identified, consistent with parental relatedness OR identity by descent. However, there are other explanations for a relatively high level of identity by descent. For example, a high overall level of homozygosity can result from unusual recombination or segregation patterns during meiosis. It may also be observed for a distantly related couple who have multiple common ancestors. The latter circumstance may occur, for example, in individuals from an isolated population that arose recently from a small founding group or in populations where cousin marriages are common. For the above reasons, the SNP data themselves are not diagnostic of a specific degree of parental relatedness.7-8 Therefore, SNP data must be interpreted in the context of additional family and social history information and the clinician must determine whether it is appropriate to pursue the question of parental consanguinity for individual families. Genetic Counseling: A referral to a clinical genetics professional is often appropriate for individuals and families undergoing whole genome microarray testing. This may be valuable both before and after testing. Families should be aware of the possibility of a result of uncertain clinical significance and the need for parental blood samples to help interpret the change. Families should also understand that findings of AOH may require additional testing of the proband before a diagnosis can be made. Clinical geneticists can guide testing strategies and further evaluate the patient in light of the test results. In some cases it may be important to discuss the potential for discovery of parental consanguinity. Genetic counseling can also elicit a thorough family and social history, which can be critical in the interpretation of the SNP array results. Autosomal recessive disease risk: Regardless of whether AOH results from uniparental disomy (UPD) or identity by descent, homozygosity anywhere in the genome raises the possibility of recessive conditions. Our reports alert the physician to the increased possibility of these conditions for regions of homozygosity greater than 10Mb. The referring physician can use this information in conjunction with clinical features and family history to determine whether mutation testing of individual genes is warranted. Limitations of the Assay Triploidy: Triploidy can be seen prenatally and appears at an appreciable frequency in miscarriages, but it is extremely rare postnatally. The three types of triploidy are 69,XXX; 69,XXY; and 69,XYY. With aCGH, 69,XXY and 69,XYY triploidy can be detected, but not 69,XXX. The SNP Microarray allows for the detection of all types of triploidy due to the capability of detecting four genotypes (AAA, AAB, ABB, and BBB) rather than the normal three genotypes (AA, AB, and BB). The failure to detect evidence of uniparental disomy does not exclude the clinical diagnosis of an imprinting-associated disorder. UPD may be of the heterodisomy type, which is not detected by the array, and mechanisms other than UPD can cause the disorder.9 Similar to the copy number-only CMA, the CMA copy number + SNP cannot detect balanced rearrangements and may not be capable of detecting low-level mosaicism. It also does not detect point mutations, small deletions or insertions below the resolution of the assay, or other types of mutations such as epigenetic changes. Finally, test results are sometimes of uncertain clinical significance, and studies of additional family members may be required to assist with interpretation. References 1. Miller DT et al.

Vitamin D in the circulation is derived from the conversion of 7-dehydrocholestrol in the skin via exposure to ultraviolet rays. It is then metabolized by hepatic 25-hydroxylase into biologically inactive 25 hydroxy vitamin D [25(OH)D; calcidiol] which by renal 1α-hydroxylase is converted into 1-25dihydroxyvitamin D [1-25(OH)2 D; calcitriol] the active vitamin D metabolite. Renal production of 1-25(OH)2 D is tightly controlled by the parathyroid hormone and is important in the regulation of serum calcium homeostasis.1 Furthermore, the discovery that most tissues and cells have vitamin D receptor and several possess the enzymatic machinery to convert primary circulating form [25(OH) D] to active form [1-25(OH)2 D] has suggested to its expanded role in decreasing the risk of many chronic diseases including infectious diseases, cancers and autoimmune diseases.2 The 25(OH)D, the principle-circulating reservoir in plasma, is the most reliable measure of overall Vitamin D status even though it is biologically inactive. It is useful in ruling out Vitamin D deficiency as a cause of hypocalcemia or osteomalacia, as well as in securing a differential diagnosis of hypercalcemia that could be indicative of excess parathyroid hormone, sarcoidois, some forms of lymphoma or other disorders. Clinical Indications Vitamin D is crucial to the bone health and overall well being of humans. Although sunlight exposure to skin may provide adequate levels of vitamin D; hypovitaminosis D is common due to minimal or no sun exposure coupled with low dietary Vitamin D intake. Recently, Vitamin D deficiency or insufficiency is recognized as the common cause of hyperparathyroidism with consequent bone loss and osteoporosis. Lack of 25hydroxy vitamin D [25(OH)D] results in hypocalcemia, osteomalacia and related disorders. This test is also useful in diagnosing intestinal malabsorption and vitamin D deficiency or intoxication, including differentiating primary hyperparathyroidism for hypercalcemia of cancer, distinguishing between vitamin D-dependent and vitamin D-resistant rickets, monitoring the vitamin D status of patients with chronic renal failure, and monitoring therapeutic response in patients being treated for Vitamin D-related disorders. Decreased or undetectable 25-hydroxy vitamin D levels indicate a deficiency due to poor diet, decreased exposure to the sun, or malabsorption of vitamin D, or liver and kidney diseases. Increased levels (over 150 ng/mL) may indicate excessive self medication or prolonged therapy. When associated with hypercalcemia there may be hypersensitivity to vitamin D, as in sarcoidosis. Interpretation Vitamin D levels are inversely associated with PTH levels and are directly related to intestinal calcium absorption. Therefore, the optimal level of vitamin D is defined as 30 ng/mL, as at this level the PTH begin to level off and intestinal Ca absorption is maximal. Vitamin D levels between 15-29 ng/mL are considered as insufficient and levels < 15 ng/mL are considered as deficient.2,3 Based on these definitions, optimal levels Vitamin D deficiency or insufficiency is highly prevalent worldwide. In contrast, Vitamin D intoxication is rare and levels greater than 150 ng/mL can be considered as toxic. Vitamin D toxicity can occur by inadvertent ingestion of very high doses [> 50,000 U] raising serum Vitamin D levels to more than 150 ng/mL. It has been shown that doses up to 10,000 U/day for many months do not cause toxicity. Limitations of the Assay Values of 25-hydroxy vitamin D can vary with exposure to sunlight and the season of the year and geographic location. There are also variations depending on race, age and during menstrual cycles, particularly at the time of ovulation. Because of the complex nature of calcium balance, it may also be useful to measure parathyroid hormone in conjunction with vitamin D. 9500 Euclid Avenue | Cleveland, Ohio 44195 | 216.444.5755 | 800.628.6816 | clevelandcliniclabs.com Cleveland Clinic Laboratories Test Information References Fasting specimen is preferred.

Vitamin D2 (ergocalciferol) is derived from plants and fungus. The endogenous form of Vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) is converted from 7-dehydrocholesterol in human skin by UV light. Vitamin D2 and D3 are prohormones that are converted to 25-hydroxy vitamin D (25OHD) in the liver, then to the physiologically active form of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D in the kidneys. 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D [calcitriol] binds to nuclear receptor proteins of tissue specific cells that regulate calcium and phosphorus metabolism. These tissues include the intestine, bone, kidney and parathyroid. In addition to its role in calcium and bone metabolism, vitamin D has been linked to many other biologic processes, including cancer risk, mortality, cardiovascular disease, autoimmune disease and infection. and mortality, autoimmune disease, cardiovascular disease and cystic fibrosis.8-9 This vitamin D assay may be used to monitor the vitamin D nutritional status in patients with diseases that interfere with fat absorption, such as cystic fibrosis and Crohn’s disease; in patients who have had gastric bypass surgery and may have impaired vitamin D absorption; or in patients with osteoporosis. The 25OHD levels are also used as an indicator of treatment effectiveness in patients being treated with vitamin D. Interpretation 25-hydroxy vitamin D (D2 + D3): <20 ng/mL = Deficiency 30-100 ng/mL= Sufficient >150 ng/mL Toxic10 The assay has large analytical measurable ranges: 1.9-114.7 ng/mL for 25OHD2 1.2-113.6 ng/mL for 25OHD3 Limitations of the Assay Monitoring vitamin D status is useful for detecting deficiency and for evaluating treatment efficacy in patients receiving vitamin D supplementation. 25-hydroxyvitamin D is the major circulating form of the vitamin and is the best indicator of vitamin D status. Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) is the preferred assay method because it has high specificity and is able to separate 25OHD2 and 25OHD3 to yield independent values rather than just the total 25OHD. This is important due to the ongoing debate concerning the difference in efficacy between D2 and D3 supplementation.1-5 1. Minimum sample size of 200 µL is required. There is some controversy over the reference intervals for 25OHD. In 2010, the Institute of Medicine (IOM) issued a position statement that recommends a reference interval of >20 ng/mL as sufficient, and >50 ng/mL as potentially toxic. The Endocrine Society released guidelines in 2011 that referenced reference intervals of <20 ng/mL as deficient and 20-30 ng/mL as insufficient. At this time there is no full consensus for 25OHD reference intervals.6-7 The assay is an isotope replacement liquid chromatographytandem mass spectrometry method that uses turbulent flow online extraction. Clinical Indications Vitamin D deficiency/insufficiency has been associated with poor bone metabolism, weak muscle strength, cancer risk 2. In chronic kidney disease, parathyroid hormone levels should be monitored along with 25OHD for accurate treatment conditions. Patients with renal failure may have very high 25OHD2 and D3 levels without toxicity due to impaired renal conversion. 3.

Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) is a clinically significant immune-mediated disorder, characterized by antibodies forming immune complexes with the chemokine platelet factor 4 (PF4) bound to unfractionated heparin (UFH), leading to paradoxical thrombosis1.The IgG immune complexes engage Fc-gamma receptor IIa (FcγRIIa) expressed on platelets and possibly leukocytes2, initiating a signal transduction cascade resulting in cellular activation. Activated platelets may potentiate thrombin generation, form thrombi, and induce a prothrombotic state involving both the venous and arterial systems3. In the process, platelets are consumed, which leads to the observed thrombocytopenia. It is critical that HIT be recognized early so that patients can be alterna- Based on the findings of a consensus report4, HIT is regarded as a clinicopathologic syndrome, requiring both clinical features and laboratory detection of the pathologic antibodies. Clinically, HIT needs to be differentiated from other potential causes of thrombocytopenia, particularly the well-characterized non-immune heparin-associated thrombocytopenia (HAT). A useful clinical scoring system, referred to as the “4Ts,” is helpful in determining whether a patient fits into the “high probability,” “intermediate probability,” or “low probability” category5.

If clinical suspicion remains high, retesting may be justified in case the antibody titer was too low to induce immune complex-mediated platelet activation in the initial work-up. • If the anti-PF4 IgG antibody ELISA is positive, but the HIPA is negative, ordering the SRA is suggested if clinical suspicion remains high. The SRA has a higher sensitivity than the HIPA. Negative anti-PF4 IgG ELISA result: • If the anti-PF4 IgG antibody ELISA is negative, HIT is very unlikely and further testing is unnecessary. In rare situations where clinical necessity dictates confirmatory testing despite a negative anti-PF4 result, the SRA is the recommended confirmatory assay since it has a higher sensitivity than the HIPA. Limitations of the Assay • A positive reaction obtained by the anti-PF4 IgG antibody screening ELISA does not confirm the diagnosis of HIT. A functional assay must be performed to confirm HIT. • The presence of immune complexes or other immunoglobulin aggregates in the patient sample may cause nonspecific binding in the ELISA and produce false positives. • The platelet functional assays are not as sensitive as the anti-PF4 IgG antibody ELISA, but have higher specificity and, therefore, should be used only as confirmatory tests. • Non-heparin dependent antibodies (such as anti-HLA) can cause platelet activation independent of heparin/PF4 immune complexes, rendering the functional assays indeterminate. Methodology Laboratory testing for HIT is a two-stage process (see flow diagram on page 2). Testing begins with a high-sensitivity ELISA screen for anti-PF4 IgG antibodies. the patient’s specimen will bind to microwells coated with PF4 complexed with polyvinyl sulfonate. After serial addition of alkaline phosphatase labeled anti-human IgG and the substrate p-nitrophenyl phosphate, the optical density (O.D.) of developed color is measured in a spectrophotometer. The anti-PF4 IgG assay is performed with the patient’s specimen with and without additional soluble heparin (final heparin concentration of 100 U/mL) as well as positive and negative controls. If the O.D. is less than 0.4, it is considered as a negative result. If the anti-PF4 IgG result is positive with the O.D. greater than 0.4, % inhibition will be calculated as follows: Patient specimen with heparin – Negative control [1- ( )] x 100 = % Inhibition Patient specimen without heparin – Negative control The inhibition of a positive reaction by 50% or more (by calculation) in the presence of excess heparin is considered confirmatory for the presence of specific antibodies that react with PF4:heparin. • Heparin dependent anti-PF4 IgG antibodies equivocal: If the O.D. > 0.4 and % inhibition with soluble heparin is < 50%, the assay is equivocal. Platelet functional assays (with higher specificity) are performed to evaluate further. Heparin-induced platelet aggregation testing (HIPA) is performed by mixing donor platelet-rich plasma (providing the platelets) with patient plasma (providing the antibodies). Low-dose UFH (0.1-0.5 U/ml) is added. If antibodies are present, immune complexes form. The antibody/PF4/heparin complexes activate the platelet FcγRIIa and the platelets aggregate (> 30% aggregation indicates a positive confirmatory result). As an additional control for specificity, high-dose UFH (100 U/ml) is also tested. The excess heparin prevents the formation of immune complexes and should not induce platelet aggregation. If aggregation is seen with the highdose heparin, the test is considered indeterminate due to non-specific cross reactivity. This test has a higher specificity for pathologic HIT than the screening assay, but the sensitivity is only 50-80%. The anti-PF4 IgG assay (GTI Diagnostics, Waukesha, WI) is performed by a solid phase ELISA method. The antibody in The serotonin release assay (SRA) (sent out) and other washed platelet assays offer more sensitive confirmatory testing • No antibodies detected: If the O.D. < 0.4, a diagnosis of HIT is unlikely (negative predictive value 97-99%), and no further testing is necessary. • Heparin dependent anti-PF4 IgG antibodies are present: If the O.D. > 0.4 and % inhibition with soluble heparin is > 50%, the assay is positive. The ordering clinician is immediately notified of the result. THE HIPA platelet functional assay (with higher specificity) is then performed to confirm the diagnosis of HIT. Recommendations to order the SRA will be made. Cleveland Clinic Laboratories (80-90%). These tests are performed in a similar manner to the HIPA, relying on donor platelets and patient plasma or serum. With the SRA, a > 20% release of serotonin in the presence of low-dose UHF is considered positive. If there is > 20% serotonin release in the presence of high-dose UFH, the test is considered indeterminate. If the screening test is positive with a high pretest probability, and the HIPA is negative, performing the SRA may be helpful.

Treponemal assays (FTA, syphilis IgG) measure antibodies that directly react with the syphilis-causing organism T. pallidum, while non-treponemal assays (RPR, VDRL) measure antibodies against non-specific cardiolipin antigens released during treponemal infections. A reactive syphilis IgG result indicates that a person has been exposed to T. pallidum at some point in his/her life. However, this testing may remain reactive for life in the majority of people who have had syphilis, even if they have been treated properly. Therefore, a positive result does not indicate that the person currently has untreated syphilis and should be confirmed with a non-treponemal test such as RPR to assess disease activity. In the past, the traditional algorithm for diagnosing syphilis was to screen initially with a non-treponemal test, followed by confirmation with a more specific treponemal test. This was largely due to the technical ease of the RPR relative to FTA or EIA testing. However, because the RPR test does not recognize treponemal-specific antibodies, a number of clinical situations can result in false-positive RPR results, including autoimmune disease,1 acute viral infection, recent immunizations or drug addiction.2-3 Most importantly, because RPR reactivity is a feature of active infection, the test can give false negative results in latent or late syphilis. If the non-treponemal test is reactive in the absence of a clinical history of treatment, it generally can be assumed that the patient has syphilis and should receive treatment. Most people become seronegative on non-treponemal tests following adequate treatment; however, some patients have a low RPR titer for life when they present with untreated late, latent or tertiary disease, despite being adequately treated.5 These patients are referred to as being “serofast.” • VDRL (CSF) is used for diagnosis of tertiary or neurosyphilis. The CDC now recommends screening the patient using a specific treponemal test and confirming with a non-treponemal test.4 The algorithm below represents Cleveland Clinic’s recommended screening for syphilis serology testing. • Samples tested reactive in the initial syphilis IgG screening test will be further tested by RPR. If the RPR tested positive, it will be followed with quantitative RPR with titer, then no further testing is required. Recommended Algorithm for Syphilis Serology Testing • When the initial syphilis IgG is weakly positive (< 0.9-5.9) and RPR is negative, then the syphilis IgG results of > 6.0 will automatically be confirmed by FTA EIA test.

Other frequent etiologies of CAP include Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Chlamydophila pneumoniae and respiratory viruses. Many different organisms can cause CAP and risk factors for specific pathogens are available in consensus guidelines for the management of CAP developed jointly by the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) and the American Thoracic Society.1 Clinical Indications Findings suggestive of CAP include productive cough, fever, pleuritic chest pain, hypoxemia and an imaging study demonstrating a pulmonary infiltrate. Microbiologic tests to determine the specific cause of CAP are often negative. However, if the etiology of CAP is determined, empiric therapy can be optimized to decrease morbidity and mortality. De-escalation of therapy can reduce pressure on the emergence of drug resistance and avoid toxic drug effects. Sputum and blood cultures prior to initiation of antimicrobial therapy are recommended for the evaluation of patients with suspected CAP. Recovery of an organism confirms the diagnosis and allows in vitro susceptibility testing to be performed. Gram stain of sputum is helpful to guide therapy and for correlation with culture results. Antigen testing is useful when empiric antimicrobial therapy prevents culture confirmation of pneumococcal disease. Urine antigen testing for S. pneumoniae and Legionella pneumophila are recommended for patients with severe CAP.1 The S. pneumoniae antigen test has a specificity of >90% and a sensitivity of 50-80% for the diagnosis of pneumococcal pneumonia in adults.1 Urinary antigen tests are not recommended for the diagnosis of pneumococcal pneumonia in children because false positive tests are common and attributed to nasopharyngeal colonization with S. pneumoniae.2,3 Methodology Cleveland Clinic Laboratories uses a qualitative immunochromatographic membrane assay (BinaxNOW® Streptococcus pneumoniae) to detect pneumococcal soluble antigen in human urine. The S. pneumoniae antigen test provides a rapid, simple method for the presumptive diagnosis of pneumococcal pneumonia. A urine specimen should be collected prior to antimicrobial therapy in a clean, leak-proof container. The specimen may be stored at room temperature if assayed within 24 hours of collection. Urine is stable for two weeks if refrigerated or frozen. Boric acid may be used as a preservative. Other preservatives are unacceptable. Interpretation and Limitations of the Assay A positive result is presumptive evidence of pneumococcal pneumonia. Correlation of test results with clinical findings is required. A negative result does not exclude infection by S. pneumoniae since the antigen present in the sample may be below the detection limit of the test. This test has not been evaluated on patients taking antibiotics for more than one day, or on patients who recently completed a course of antibiotic therapy.4 Cross-reactivity with closely related bacteria in the Streptococcus mitis group may occur. Streptococcus pneumoniae vaccine may cause false positive results within two days following vaccination and is not recommended within five days following pneumococcal vaccination. This test has only been validated for urine samples.

Approximately 48 million people become ill and 128,000 require hospitalization from foodborne diseases in the United States each year.1 Enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) is one of the top five causes of foodborne illness requiring hospitalization in the United States.1 Most clinical laboratories that perform enteric cultures on stool samples routinely include media and methods to rule out Campylobacter spp., Salmonella spp., Shigella spp., and EHEC. Shigella, which accounts for less disease prevalence in the U.S. (~14,000 cases/year), is highly infectious and its detection in all stool samples is important to prevent further disease from spreading person to person. Shigella, which accounts for less disease prevalence in the U.S. (~ 14,000 cases/ year) is highly infectious and its detection in all stool samples is important to prevent further disease from spreading person to person. Yersinia enterocolitica can also cause foodborne disease but at a much lower incidence; consequently most laboratories do not routinely look for this pathogen. The incidence of Y. enterocolitica as reported by CDC Food Net activities is about one culture confirmed case per 100,000 population per year. This compares to the > 1 million cases of Salmonella and > 800,000 cases of Campylobacter reported annually to CDC in the U.S.2 Blood transfusion reactions have occurred from blood products contaminated with Y. enterocolitica, however gastroenteritis is not usually a part of the resultant bacteremia. Y. enterocolitica can cause gastroenteritis in an individual who has consumed contaminated food or water. Y. enterocolitica has been isolated from raw meats such as beef, lamb, pork and chicken, but can also be found in cooked, pre-packaged deli meats. Consumption of raw or improperly cooked pork is the main source of gastroenteritis in humans, with the specific association with improperly prepared and handled pork chitterlings.3,4,5,6 Drinking unpasteurized milk or untreated water, or contact with infected animals also can be the source of infection. Severity of the disease is related to the specific serotype of Y. enterocolitica as well as load of organism consumed. The range of disease associated with Y. enterocolitica is a self-limited gastroenteritis to terminal ileitis, to a mesenteric lymphadenitis that is often mistaken as an appendicitis. Occasionally, skin rash and joint pains can accompany Yersinia gastroenteritis.1,3 Children are more commonly diagnosed with Y. enterocolitica disease than are adults. Patients with gastroenteritis associated with Yersinia are more likely to present with fever, diarrhea and abdominal pain that can last for seven days. A carrier state of the organism can ensue for up to several months. Septicemia can result if organisms migrate out of the gastrointestinal tract via the lymphatics and find their way to lymph nodes. Persons at highest risk for systemic disease are the elderly and immunocompromised populations. In particular, persons with underlying metabolic diseases that are associated with iron overload (hemochromatosis), cancer, liver disease and steroid therapy are at highest risk of more serious Y. enterocolitica disease. A case of ileal perforation post gastroenteritis has been reported with a review of other surgical complications of Yersinia gastroenteritis.6 Clinical Indications A request for Yersinia culture from stool should be made if a patient is suspected of having gastroenteritis associated with Yersinia, for example, when there has been exposure to undercooked pork chitterlings, or when routine stool cultures are negative for Salmonella and Campylobacter. In addition, patients presenting with diarrhea and associated symptoms of appendicitis and/or septicemia should be considered for a Yersinia culture request. This should be done as an adjunct to the routine culture and not in place of it. Children, the elderly and immunocompromised patients are the more likely patients at risk for Yersinia gastroenteritis. Results and/or Interpretation Yersinia enterocolitica can grow on most routine laboratory media, including Maconkey’s agar, but they grow more slowly than other members of the normal GI flora Enterobacteriaceae. Cefsulodin-irgasan-novobiocin (CIN) agar will be planted in addition to a Maconkey’s agar when a request is made for isolation of Y. enterocolitica. Most results should be available within 48-72 hours after collection and processing of the stool samples. Growth and identification specifically as Y. enterocolitica will be considered a positive result; no growth 9500 Euclid Avenue | Cleveland, Ohio 44195 | 216.444.5755 | 800.628.6816 | clevelandcliniclabs.com Cleveland Clinic Laboratories as a negative result. Serotyping of the Y. enterocolitica is not performed routinely in clinical laboratories and is not widely available in reference laboratories. Most cases of Yersinia gastroenteritis are self-limited and do not require treatment. However, if there is concomitant systemic disease and/or if the patient is immunocompromised, susceptibility testing can be performed. Limitations Overgrowth with normal flora GI bacteria and/or other GI pathogens may limit the growth of Y. enterocolitica. Culture of stool samples after beginning treatment may limit detection. Methodology Y. enterocolitica is a gram negative bacterium that can be isolated in culture from stool specimens. Stool should be submitted to the laboratory within one hour of collection or transported in Cary Blair transport media and refrigerated if there will be delays. The order should be placed for a Yersinia culture when the stool is submitted. Cultures are performed seven days per week. 2.

The main sources of infection with STEC are contaminated raw or insufficiently cooked foods of animal origin, for example, meat and dairy products. Each year, STEC causes an estimated 73,000 cases of hemorrhagic colitis.1,2 Approximately 38%-61% of individuals who are infected with STEC will develop hemorrhagic colitis; 5-10% of patients infected with STEC will develop HUS, and 10% of those who develop HUS will die or have permanent renal failure.2 Initially, a particular serovar, E. coli O157: H7, appeared to be responsible for the majority of cases of colitis and its consequences. Subsequent studies have reported that as many as 30%-50% of STEC infections are caused by nonO157:H7 E. coli, but common to these is the presence of a Shiga toxin.3 Many serovars of E. coli that possess the Shiga toxin now have been identified, and these would be missed if one confines testing to detection of E. coli O157:H7 alone. In 2006, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) recommended that laboratories implement an assay that would detect all Shiga-toxin producing E. coli on all stools that are routinely submitted for routine enteric pathogen testing.4 The STEC assays can detect two different toxins, described as Shiga toxin 1 and Shiga toxin 2. Toxin 2 is associated with a fourfold more likely chance for development of HUS and other complications, although both toxins have been associated with HUS.2,5 Antibiotics should not be used to treat STEC infections, since this has been shown to increase the risk of HUS development.6 Clinical Indications Diarrhea caused by enterohemorrhagic E. coli strains are most often seen in patients who acquire the organism in the community, not in the hospital. This is the same for other community-associated enteric pathogens such as Salmonella and Shigella. Patients who have been in the hospital for > 3 days when symptoms of diarrhea develop are likely to have Clostridium difficile enterocolitis and not enterohemorrhagic E.coli. However, in patients hospitalized because of bloody diarrhea and/or hemolytic uremic syndrome, testing for Shiga toxin is appropriate. The presence of blood in stool samples always has been a potential marker for E. coli O157:H7, however, many patients with STEC infections will not present with bloody diarrhea.7 Shiga toxin testing will be performed on all stool samples that are submitted to the Clinical Microbiology laboratory for detection of enteric bacterial pathogens regardless of whether the samples are bloody. Routine testing of these stools also includes culture for detection of Salmonella spp. and Shigella spp. and enzyme immunoassay for the detection of Campylobacter jejuni. Reporting and Interpretation Stool samples that are found positive for either Shiga toxin 1 or Shiga toxin 2 will be reported as positive for either or both. Samples that are negative will be reported as negative for both Shiga toxins. Shiga toxin 1 produced by E. coli is similar to the toxin produced by Shigella dysenteriae type 1 strains. Therefore the EIA may yield a positive result in patients infected with S. dysenteriae type 1 strains, however, the incidence of S. dysenteriae in the United States is very low. Results will also include positive and negative findings for Salmonella, Shigella, and C. jejuni. Reporting codes: Positive for Shiga toxin 1 Negative for Shiga toxin 2 OR Negative for Shiga toxin 1 Positive for Shiga toxin 2 OR Negative for Shiga toxin 1 Negative for Shiga toxin 2 OR Positive for Shiga toxin 1 Positive for Shiga toxin 2 Limitations of the Assay This immunochromatographic assay is a qualitative assay and can not be used to determine any quantitative results. Test results should be used in conjunction with clinical information about the patient. 9500 Euclid Avenue | Cleveland, Ohio 44195 | 216.444.5755 | 800.628.6816 | clevelandcliniclabs.com Cleveland Clinic Laboratories Shiga toxin 1 produced by E. coli and the toxin produced by Shigella dysenteriae type 1 strains are nearly identical. The immunochromatographic result of positive for Shiga toxin 1 could represent infection with either E. coli or S. dysenteriae. Culture will always be performed along with routine enteric pathogen requests. If Shigella dysenteriae were the producer of the Shiga toxin it should be positive in culture. Antibiotic treatment of hemorrhagic colitis due to E. coli is contraindicated since it may worsen the risk of hemolytic uremic syndrome; however, if S. dysenteriae is present, antibiotic treatment may be indicated. All stool samples with a positive Shiga toxin result will be sent to the ODH for confirmation of the enteric pathogen as E. coli and to rule out the possibility of S. dysenteriae. In addition, our routine processing of the stool includes examination for Shigella spp,which is reported along with results of the Shiga toxin if it is found. Methodology The assay used in the Clinical Microbiology laboratory is an FDA-cleared commercial immunochromatographic rapid test that utilizes monoclonal antibodies that will complex with any Shiga toxin (1 and/or 2) antigen that is present in a brothenhanced stool sample. A control area on the assay card is present for each sample, and results can only be reported for presence of the toxins if the control card is also positive. References 1. Noris M and G Remuzzi.

Approximately 48 million people become ill and 128,000 require hospitalization from foodborne diseases in the United States each year.1 Enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) is one of the top five causes of foodborne illness requiring hospitalization in the United States.1 Most clinical laboratories that perform enteric cultures on stool samples routinely include media and methods to rule out Campylobacter spp., Salmonella spp., Shigella spp., and EHEC. Shigella, which accounts for less disease prevalence in the U.S. (~14,000 cases/year), is highly infectious and its detection in all stool samples is important to prevent further disease from spreading person to person. Clinical Indications Stool samples from outpatients or patients hospitalized less than three days are accepted for detection of enteric bacterial pathogens. Most commonly, bacterial diarrhea will be caused by strains of Salmonella, Shigella, Campylobacter or EHEC. If patients have been in the hospital for longer than three days when their diarrhea occurs, the likelihood that it is being caused by one of these enteric pathogens is close to 0%, as a number of studies have shown.2,3 Clostridium difficile toxin testing by PCR should be ordered for the evaluation of diarrhea in patients hospitalized more than three days. Results and/or Interpretation When stools are submitted for routine culture of enteric pathogens, cultures will be performed on selective media for the isolation of Salmonella spp., Shigella sp., and E. coli O157:H7. In addition, enzyme immunoassays (EIAs) will be performed for detection of Campylobacter jejuni and the Shiga toxin produced by E. coli. EHEC strains may produce both Shiga toxin 1 and Shiga toxin 2 or only one toxin (Shiga toxin 1 or Shiga toxin 2). Shiga toxin 1 produced by E. coli is similar to the toxin produced by Shigella dysenteriae type 1 strains. Therefore the EIA may yield a positive result in patients infected with S. dysenteriae type 1 strains, however, isolation of S. dysenteriae is rare in the U.S.4,5,6 Negative and Positive Results will be given for each pathogen, for example: • Positive for Salmonella serogroup (A,B---), sent to state for serotyping • Negative for Shigella and E. coli O157:H7 by culture • Negative for Campylobacter by EIA • Negative for Shiga Toxin 1 and 2 by EIA Limitations of the Assay Overgrowth with normal flora bacteria from the GI tract may limit the growth of any pathogens. Culture of stool samples after beginning treatment may limit detection. If less common bacterial pathogens, such as Vibrio cholerae or V. parahemolyticus, Aeromonas/Plesiomonas, or Yersinia enterocolitica are suspected, special requests for these cultures must be submitted with the stool sample. Methodology Placement of stool into Cary Blair transport media, which has a much longer allowable transit time is preferred. Alternatively, stool may be transported in a sterile container if received within 1 hour of collection. Cultures and EIA tests are performed seven days per week. When appropriate, isolates of enteric pathogens and Shiga-toxin EIA positive broth cultures will be submitted to Ohio Department of Health for confirmation and/or serotyping. 9500 Euclid Avenue | Cleveland, Ohio 44195 | 216.444.5755 | 800.628.6816 | clevelandcliniclabs.com Cleveland Clinic Laboratories References 1. http://www.cdc.gov/foodborneburden/2011-foodborneestimates.html.

These infections can range from a mild, self-limiting illness to severe disease that can cause death. More severe disease is seen in the young, the immunocompromised and the elderly. It is estimated that an average 24,000 deaths each year are attributed to influenza in the United States.1 In children, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the most common cause of severe lower respiratory tract infection worldwide. Timely detection of these viruses can lead to initiation of proper antiviral treatment, decreased use of unnecessary antibiotics, reduced transmission of disease from person to person and better clinical outcomes.2 Due to low sensitivity of respiratory viral rapid antigen tests and the long turn-around time of viral culture, many laboratories are using PCR-based methods for detection of respiratory viruses.3 Many laboratories have used multiplexed Respiratory Viral Panel (RVP) tests during the past two to three years. These multiplex RVP tests have demonstrated the ability to detect many respiratory viruses in most patients with influenza-like illness (ILI). eSensor technology from GenMark Diagnostics (GenMarkDx, Carlsbad, CA) is a novel assay with results comparable to the gold standard viral culture and DFA. Discordant results were minimal. In addition, the RVP detected co-infections, which is important for cohorting of patients. Clinical Indications The Respiratory Viral Panel is a comprehensive assay for the detection of a broad range of viruses and subtypes representing the majority of circulatory respiratory diseasecausing pathogens of particular importance to children, elderly and immunocompromised patients. The following virus types and subtypes are identified using the eSensor RVP: • Influenza A, Influenza A H1, Influenza A H3, Influenza A H1N1 2009, • Influenza B, • Respiratory Syncytial Virus A, Respiratory Syncytial Virus B, • Parainfluenza Virus 1, Parainfluenza Virus 2, Parainfluenza Virus 3, • Human Metapneumovirus, • Human Rhinovirus, • Adenovirus B/E, C. Interpretation The RVP test has a high sensitivity and specificity, therefore a positive test in the appropriate clinical setting indicates infection by the virus and a negative test largely excludes infection by the particular virus. Limitations of the Assay Due to the genetic similarity between human rhinovirus and poliovirus, the eSensor RVP cannot reliably differentiate them. If a polio infection is suspected, a positive eSensor RVP human rhinovirus result should be confirmed by using an alternate method (e.g., cell culture). Methodology eSensor technology uses a solid-phase electrochemical method for determining the presence of one or more of a defined panel of virus target sequences. Purified DNA/RNA is isolated from the patient specimen and the extracted nucleic acid is reverse transcribed and/or amplified using viral specific primers with RT-PCR enzyme mix. The amplified DNA is converted to single-stranded DNA via exonuclease digestion and is then combined with a signal buffer containing ferrocene-labeled signal probes that are specific for the different viral targets. The mixture of amplified sample and signal buffer is loaded onto a cartridge containing single-stranded oligonucleotide capture probes bound to gold-plated electrodes. The cartridge is inserted into the XT-8 instrument where the single-stranded targets hybridize to the complementary sequences of the capture probes and signal probes. The presence of each target is determined by voltammetry, which generates specific electrical signals from the ferrocene-labeled signal probe. 9500 Euclid Avenue | Cleveland, Ohio 44195 | 216.444.5755 | 800.628.6816 | clevelandcliniclabs.com Cleveland Clinic Laboratories References 1.

Patients enrolled in pain management programs need to be monitored for compliance, which means appropriate use of prescribed drugs and abstinence from non-prescribed drugs. Urine is the most commonly used specimen in monitoring pain management and illicit drug use. A single urine specimen can be tested for a number of drugs. Immunoassay (IA) can be used as a screening method, but it lacks specificity and sensitivity. For example, most immunoassay tests cannot distinguish various opiate drugs and cannot detect oxymorphone at all.3-4 In addition, immunoassay is only semiquantitative and clinicians in some cases need quantitative assessment of urine drug concentrations.3 For example, the morphine-to-codeine ratio can help identify heroine abusers.5 High performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS) offers high resolving power, high selectivity and wide dynamic range, all of which enable simultaneous quantification of a broad spectrum of drugs present in biological matrices.3 In clinical laboratories, HPLC-MS/MS can be used as a confirmation method in conjunction with a prior immunoassay-based screening method, or it can be used as a stand-alone screening method offering quantitative results with high confidence. Some drugs/metabolites (e.g. morphine, codeine and THCA) are present in urine as both free and glucuronide conjugates. The conjugation rate varies significantly. In order to have consistent results, conjugated drugs are usually converted to free drugs prior to HPLC-MS/MS analysis. Chemical hydrolysis is very efficient but may result in unwanted reactions. For example, acid hydrolysis will convert heroin and its metabolite, 6-monoacetylmorphine (6-MAM), to morphine.6 In contrast, enzymatic hydrolysis is much milder, but needs longer incubation time to achieve sufficient (>80%) hydrolysis efficiency.7 Cleveland Clinic Laboratories offer an HPLC-MS/MS method for quantitative screening of 11 pain management drugs and five other commonly abused drugs in urine.8 In this method, total drug concentration is measured after enzymatic hydrolysis. This assay also includes an adulteration test using urine test strips to ensure specimen quality. In addition to pain management, this test can also be used for monitoring patient compliance in rehabilitation programs. The high sensitivity of this method is capable of detecting drug manufacturing impurities. As an example, codeine is a known manufacturing impurity in morphine (~0.04%) and can be detected by this method.9 Clinical Information This test detects the following 11 pain management drugs in urine: Morphine Codeine Dihydrocodeine Oxycodone Oxymorphone Hydrocodone Hydromorphone Methadone and metabolite Fentanyl and metabolite Tramadol and metabolite Buprenorphine and metabolite Also included are five commonly abused drugs that are not prescribed for pain management: Amphetamine Methamphetamine Cocaine metabolite Heroin metabolite Marijuana metabolite In most cases, both parent drug and metabolite are quantified. Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC, the main active component of marijuana), cocaine and heroin have rather short half-lives and therefore only the stable metabolites are analyzed. As a result, a total of 20 analytes are measured in this test (Table 1). 9500 Euclid Avenue | Cleveland, Ohio 44195 | 216.444.5755 | 800.628.6816 | clevelandcliniclabs.com This test can assist clinicians to determine patient compliance. Presence of prescribed drugs/metabolites and absence of non-prescribed drugs/metabolites indicate patient compliance. Test results are for medical purposes only. Detailed data interpretations for each analyte are listed below: Interpretation Codeine: Codeine is not a recognized metabolite of other opiates and its presence indicates use of a codeine-containing drug. Codeine is metabolized to morphine. Other minor metabolites include hydrocodone, hydromorphone and dihydrocodeine. Use of heroin is indicated when 1) both codeine and morphine are detected in urine; 2) morphine concentration is >10,000 ng/mL; and 3) morphine-to-codeine ratio is above 2. Table 1 lists the lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) and higher limit of quantification (HLOQ) for each analyte in the Pain Panel. A result greater than the LLOQ for a parent drug and/or metabolite indicates use of the drug. Table 1. Analytical Measurement Ranges Analyte Morphine Codeine LLOQ (ng/ml) HLOQ (ng/ml) 5 5365 11 5484 Dihydrocodeine 5 5184 Oxycodone 5 4719 Oxymorphone 5 4581 Hydrocodone 8 5270 Hydromorphone 5 4980 16 4897 EDDP 6 4178 Fentanyl 6 5971 Norfentanyl 6 5514 Tramadol 25 5208 O-desmethyl Tramadol 20 5000 Buprenorphine 20 5000 Norbuprenorphine 20 4300 Amphetamine 5 5365 Methamphetamine 8 5339 Benzoylecgonine 24 5410 6-Acetylmorphine 5 4800 21 5008 Methadone THCA The level of drugs/metabolites in urine is affected by dose, metabolic rate, sample collection time relative to the drug use and hydration status. Morphine: Morphine may arise from morphine-containing drugs, poppy seeds or by metabolism of codeine and heroin. Morphine is metabolized to hydromorphone. Dihydrocodeine: The presence of dihydrocodeine may arise from dihydrocodeine-containing drugs or from the metabolism of hydrocodone. Dihydrocodeine is also metabolized to hydrocodone. Oxycodone: Oxycodone is not a recognized metabolite of other opiates and its presence indicates use of an oxycodonecontaining drug. Oxycodone is metabolized to oxymorphone. Oxymorphone: Oxymorphone may arise from oxymorphonecontaining drugs or by metabolism of oxycodone. Hydrocodone: Hydrocodone may arise from hydrocodonecontaining drugs or by metabolism of dihydrocodeine. Hydrocodone is metabolized to hydromorphone and dihydrocodeine. Hydromorphone: Hydromorphone may arise from hydromorphone-containing drugs or by metabolism of morphine and hydrocodone. Amphetamine: Amphetamine may arise from amphetaminecontaining drugs (eg. Adderall and Benzedrine) or by metabolism of methamphetamine. Clobenzorex, famprofazone, fenethylline, fenproporex and mefenorex contain amphetamine pro-drugs that can be metabolized to amphetamine. Selegiline is metabolized to both amphetamine and methamphetamine. Methamphetamine: Methamphetamine may arise from methamphetamine-containing drugs or metabolism of selegiline, which is metabolized to both methamphetamine and amphetamine. Over-the-counter inhalers for nasal decongestion may cause positive methamphetamine results. Methamphetamine is metabolized to amphetamine. Benzoylecgonine: Benzoylecgonine is a metabolite of cocaine. Presence of benzoylecgonine indicates use of cocaine. Methadone: Presence of methadone indicates use of a methadone-containing drug. Methadone is metabolized to EDDP (2-ethylidene-1,5-dimethyl1-3,3-diphenylpyrrolidine). Urine methadone levels vary widely depending on metabolism and urine pH. However, urine EDDP levels are less affected by pH and are preferable for assessing compliance with methadone therapy. The absence of EDDP and presence of methadone in a urine specimen very likely indicate adulteration by direct addition of methadone to the urine specimen. EDDP: EDDP (2-ethylidene-1,5-dimethyl-3,3-diphenylpyrrolidine) is a metabolite of methadone, and its presence indicates use of a methadone-containing drug. Table 2. Adulteration test results Urine Test Strip Results Creatinine 10 - 20 mg/dL and specific gravity < 1.003 Clinical Interpretation Dilution Creatinine <10 mg/dL and specific gravity < 1.003 or >1.020 Substitution Presence of oxidant and/or pH<3 or pH>10 Adulteration Methodology Fentanyl: Presence of fentanyl indicates use of a fentanylcontaining drug. Fentanyl is metabolized to norfentanyl. 1) Isotope-labeled internal standards are added to each urine sample. Norfentanyl: Norfentanyl is a metabolite of fentanyl, and its presence indicates use of a fentanyl-containing drug. 2) All samples are subjected to enzymatic hydrolysis (16-24 hours) to convert glucuronide conjugates to free drugs. Hydrolysis efficiency is >90% for all drugs. Tramadol: Presence of tramadol indicates use of a tramadolcontaining drug (Ultram). Tramadol is metabolized to O-Desmethyltramadol. O-Desmethyltramadol: O-Desmethyltramadol is an active metabolite of Tramadol and its presence indicates use of a tramadol-containing drug (Ultram). THCA: Tetrahydrocannabinol carboxylic acid (THCA) is a metabolite of delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol, which is the main active component of marijuana. Presence of THCA indicates use of marijuana. 6-MAM: 6-MAM (6-monoacetylmorphine, also known as 6-acetylmorphine) is a unique metabolite of heroin. Presence of 6-MAM indicates use of heroin. 6-MAM is further metabolized to morphine and absence of 6-MAM does not rule out the use of heroin. Buprenorphine: Presence of buprenorphine indicates use of buprenorphine-containing drugs (e.g. Suboxone and Buprenex). Buprenorphine is metabolized to norbuprenorphine. Norbuprenorphine: Norbuprenorphine is the primary active metabolite of buprenorphine. Presence of norbuprenorphine indicates use of buprenorphine-containing drugs (e.g. Suboxone and Buprenex). 3) After hydrolysis, samples are analyzed by turbulent flow online extraction and HPLC-MS/MS in the multiple reaction monitoring mode. 4) Analyte concentration is calculated based on analyte to internal standard peak area ratio with the use of a calibration curve. 5) A specimen quality test is included with this testing that measures creatinine concentration, specific gravity, pH and presence of oxidant.

PSA was detected in blood and the concentration of PSA was increased in cases of prostate cancer or other prostatic diseases, such as benign prostatic hyperplasia.1 Serum PSA measurement was shown to enhance early detection of prostate cancer, leading to the recognition of its potential as a screening test.2 Serum PSA alone, or combined with a digital rectal exam (DRE), have been used in clinical trials for early detection of prostate cancer.3-4 A recent multicenter study using serum PSA tests with various cutoffs between 2.6 and 4.0 ng/ml showed a 20% reduction in prostate cancer specific mortality.4 biopsy. Results showed that more than 15% of these men had prostate cancer.5 The detection rate of prostate cancer is about 47% in men with serum PSA in the range of 4-10 ng/mL.5 However, the cancer rate is very similar for men with a PSA range of 2.0-3.0 ng/mL(23%) and that with PSA of 3.0-4.0 ng/ml (26%). Table 1. Likelihood of cancer based on PSA Level PSA (ng/mL) ≤1.0 1.1 - 2.0 17.0 2.1 - 3.0 23.9 3.1 - 4.0 26.9 Limitations of PSA 4.1 - 10.0 47.0 PSA as a marker is only prostatic tissue-specific, rather than cancer-specific. Increased PSA in serum was not only detected in patients with prostate cancer, but also in benign prostatic disease.1 This phenomenon resulted in a significant false positive rate in PSA-based detection of prostate cancer based on biopsy results from those patients. The other disadvantage for PSA is that PSA-based detection of prostate cancer often resulted in over-diagnosis of low-grade cancer that may have never become clinically significant. Several approaches to improve the distinction between cancer and benign conditions have been proposed, including use of age-adjusted PSA reference ranges, PSA density, PSA velocity and free-to-total PSA ratio. >10.0 58.2 Clinical Significance The traditional cutoff for serum PSA is 4.0 ng/ml. PSA values >4.0 ng/mL were considered abnormal, and these patients were further evaluated with invasive diagnostic approaches, such as prostate biopsy or transrectal ultrasonography of the prostate.1 However, multiple studies suggest that the risk of prostate cancer in men with PSA levels <4.0 ng/mL is significant (see Table 1). For example, the prostate cancer prevention trial (PCPT) included 2.950 participants who had PSA levels < 4.0 ng/mL and who underwent an end-of-study Risk for prostate cancer on biopsy (%) 8.8 Data from the PCPT demonstrated that there is no PSA level below which the risk of having prostate cancer is zero and suggest that there is no “normal” reference range for PSA. The detection rate of prostate cancer is significantly correlated to the serum PSA levels. Lowering the PSA cutoff of 4.0 ng/ml to 2.6 ng/ml would increase detection of prostate cancer, while also slightly increasing false positive results.6-8 Test Update Information The new PSA reference range is 0-2.59 ng/ml; the upper limit is cutoff value for further evaluation. The following comment will be included with each PSA result: “For an individual patient, the significance of a PSA level should be interpreted in a broad clinical context, including age, race, family history, digital rectal examination, prostate size, results of prior testing (prostate biopsy, free PSA, PCA3) and use of 5-alpha-reductase inhibitors. Considering the high incidence of asymptomatic cancer in the general population that may not pose an ultimate risk to the patient, the decision to recommend urological evaluation or prostate biopsy should be individualized after considering all of these factors.” 9500 Euclid Avenue | Cleveland, Ohio 44195 | 216.444.5755 | 800.628.6816 | clevelandcliniclabs.com Cleveland Clinic Laboratories A useful tool that incorporates many of these variables for calculating the risk of cancer is available at: http://www. compass.fhcrc.org/edrnnci/bin/calculator/main.asp?t=prostate &sub=disclaimer&v=prostate&m=x=Prostate%20Cancer.

In the normal state procalcitonin is synthesized primarily in the C cells of the thyroid gland, where it undergoes intracellular cleavage to produce calcitonin. As a result, circulating levels of PCT are very low or undetectable in healthy donors. However, in response to severe systemic inflammation such as seen with severe bacterial infection, PCT is expressed in numerous tissues throughout the body, resulting in increased levels of circulating PCT. Unlike many inflammatory molecules, PCT is relatively stable in blood, with a half-life of 24-36 hours, which allows it to serve as a useful monitor for the presence and resolution of systemic inflammation. Clinical Indications The majority of published uses for PCT have focused on its role as an aid in the diagnosis and monitoring of a variety of serious infectious diseases, including severe bacterial sepsis, septic shock and pneumonia. A large body of literature has focused on the use of PCT in the ICU setting, and the intended use in the FDA clearance of the current assay is “in conjunction with other laboratory findings and clinical assessments in the risk assessment of critically ill patients on their first day of ICU admission for progression to severe sepsis and septic shock.”1 PCT’s diagnostic potential also has been evaluated in many other clinical situations, including emergency department admissions, neonatal sepsis, pneumonia, FUO in neutropenic patients and rheumatologic diseases. Results from these studies have been variable, with PCT’s sensitivity and specificity as a diagnostic marker varying widely depending on the specific characteristics of the study population.2 In contrast to the use of PCT for diagnosis of sepsis, an emerging area of interest has focused on the use of PCT to monitor response to antibiotic therapy. Because of PCT’s relatively short half-life in blood, levels will drop in a matter of days once the underlying infectious stimulus has been removed. Various groups have looked at the use of algorithms based on changes in PCT levels to titrate the duration of antibiotic treatment in septic patients as well as in patients with respiratory infections.3-5 While initial results in this area have been promising, further work is needed to determine how best to integrate PCT measurements into routine clinical practice. Interpretation Reference range: < 0.07 ng/mL. Based on studies in ICU patients, procalcitonin levels > 2.00 ng/mL at time of ICU admission represent an elevated risk of progression to severe sepsis and/or septic shock; levels < 0.50 ng/mL represent a lower risk of severe sepsis and/or septic shock. Levels < 0.50 ng/mL do not exclude infection as early stage (< 6 hrs) localized infections or systemic infections can be associated with low concentrations. Levels 0.50 - 2.00 ng/mL should be interpreted in the clinical context of the patient as a variety of non-infectious conditions such as burns, trauma, surgery and severe cardiogenic shock can cause procalcitonin elevations.1 Limitations of the Assay Serious, non-infectious stresses such as trauma, burns or surgery can lead to a rise in PCT in the absence of sepsis. Patients with medullary carcinoma of the thyroid may show increased PCT levels in the absence of sepsis. PCT may not be elevated in patients with localized infection, or in samples taken shortly (< 6 hrs) after initial infection. Methodology Procalcitonin is measured using the Vidas® PCT assay (bioMérieux, Durham, NC), a one-step immunoassay sandwich method with fluorescent detection. Patient sample is dispensed into wells containing anti-PCT antibodies labeled with alkaline phosphatase. This mixture is cycled in and out of a solid-phase receptacle (SPR) several times, allowing the antigen to bind with immunoglobulins fixed to the wall of 9500 Euclid Avenue | Cleveland, Ohio 44195 | 216.444.5755 | 800.628.6816 | clevelandcliniclabs.com Cleveland Clinic Laboratories the SPR to form a sandwich. Detection is accomplished by cycling a fluorescent substrate for alkaline phosphatase (4MUP) in and out of the SPR and measuring the amount of fluorescence produced. The intensity of fluorescence is proportional to the concentration of PCT present in the sample. 4. Kopterides P, Siempos II, Tsangaris I, Tsantes A, Armaganidis A.

While PSA is a useful marker available for this disease, its utility is limited in many common clinical situations. For screening purposes, PSA utility is limited because it is prostate specific but not cancer specific; consequently, there is no PSA lower limit of detection for which the risk of prostate cancer is zero. For predicting biologically significant disease, the predictive value of PSA is limited because higher grade tumors often express little PSA. Decisions regarding the need for re-biopsy in men with an elevated PSA are limited because PSA usually is more reflective of prostate volume rather than the risk of carcinoma. mRNA of the prostate cancer antigen 3 (PCA3) gene has been shown to be over-expressed (median 66-fold) in >95% of prostate cancer tissue compared with normal or benign prostate tissue.1,2 PCA3 is prostate cancer specific, and the PCA3 assay is unaffected by prostate volume. Therefore, the PCA3 assay addresses many of the issues related to PSA screening, improves the sensitivity and specificity of PSA interpretation and may add other information more reflective of tumor biology. Low levels of PCA3 mRNA have been shown to correlate with a low probability of biopsy-proven prostatic adenocarcinoma.3,4 Clinical Indications PCA3 is useful: 1. in conjunction with PSA screening of high-risk individuals (those with positive family history), where serum PSA may be normal and not reflect true cancer risk; 2. in deciding on the need for re-biopsy in men with elevated PSA and prior negative biopsy, as published studies have demonstrated that, in this setting, PCA3 improves diagnostic accuracy; 3. in the selection of men for active surveillance, as published studies have demonstrated that PCA3 correlates with tumor volume and can help identify those with biologically insignificant tumors. Interpretation PCA3 results are reported as a score ranging from 4 to 125, the ratio of PCA3 mRNA to PSA mRNA. Likelihood of a positive biopsy increases as the score increases. A score of 35 is considered the cutoff for positive vs. negative PCA3 result.

Diagnosis of Trichomonas infection proves challenging in that the traditional wet mount method relies on detecting motility of the parasite, which is often lost during delays in transport or refrigeration. Wet mount preparations are less than optimal when transport time exceeds six hours.2 Optimal transport time is one hour or less. Alternative methods for diagnosis of Trichomonas infection include EIA methods, in-office physician performed microscopy, culture and molecular methods. Molecular diagnostic methods have cost-to-patient charges that are significantly higher than other methods. Wet mount microscopy has a reported sensitivity of 58% versus culture.3 The OSOM® Trichomonas Rapid Test is an FDA-approved CLIA waived test that offers a simple inexpensive option with improved sensitivity for diagnosis of Trichomonas infection as compared to wet prep. The test is intended for qualitative detection of Trichomonas vaginalis antigen from vaginal swabs or from the saline solution prepared when making wet mounts from vaginal swabs. Clinical Indications The OSOM® Trichomonas Rapid Test is intended for the qualitative detection of Trichomonas vaginalis antigen from genital swabs. The test is intended for use in patients with symptoms of vaginosis or suspected exposure to the organism. Results and/or Interpretation If Trichomonas is present in the sample, it will form a complex with the primary anti-Trichomonas antibody conjugated to blue-colored particles. The complex will then be bound by a second anti-Trichomonas antibody coated on the nitrocellulose membrane. The appearance of a visible blue test line along with the red control line (internal control) indicates a positive result. Limitations of the Assay The OSOM® Trichomonas Rapid test has not been approved for urine samples. The test has only been validated for qualitative detection of T. vaginalis antigen from vaginal swabs. Molecular methodology is recommended for urine specimens. A negative result may be obtained if the specimen is inadequate or if the antigen concentration is below the sensitivity of the test. Samples contaminated with preparations containing iodine or by the immediate prior use of vaginal lubricants are not recommended. The test does not differentiate between viable and non-viable organisms nor does it differentiate between acute infection and carrier states. Staphylococcus aureus in specimens at concentrations higher than 1 X 108 cfu/ml may interfere with the test results in negative samples. These concentrations are higher than would be expected to be present in normal patient samples. The OSOM® Trichomonas Rapid Test is reported to detect as little as 2500 organisms/ml per manufacturer’s package insert. Methodology The OSOM® Trichomonas Rapid Test is an immunochromatographic test that utilizes capillary flow dipstick technology. The test requires solubilization of the Trichomonas proteins from the swab by mixing the sample in the sample buffer. A sample test strip is then added allowing the subsequent migration of the sample along the membrane surface of the dipstick. 9500 Euclid Avenue | Cleveland, Ohio 44195 | 216.444.5755 | 800.628.6816 | clevelandcliniclabs.com Cleveland Clinic Laboratories References 1.

Many organic acids are present in urine from clinically normal individuals. Elevated levels of specific organic acids or elevations of combinations of specific organic acids are often seen in the organic acidurias, disorders in which one or more metabolic pathways of organic acid metabolism are blocked. Abnormal urinary organic acids are also seen in some disorders of amino acid metabolism, some disorders of mitochondrial fatty acid beta-oxidation, and some disorders of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation. All of these disorders are genetic conditions. Abnormal urinary organic acids can also be seen in certain pathologic, non-genetic states such as ketosis associated with starvation or diabetes and some types of renal dysfunction. An analysis of urinary organic acids is usually a key test in the evaluation of patients with a suspected genetic disorder of organic acid metabolism and is frequently used in the evaluation of persons with possible genetic disorders of mitochondrial fatty acid metabolism, amino acid disorders, and disorders of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation. Some of the common clinical indications for ordering a urinary organic acid analysis include evaluation of: • neonates and infants with an unexplained life-threatening phenotype • infants, children and selected adults with unexplained cognitive disability or developmental regression • infants, children and selected adults with unexplained epilepsy • any age individual with unexplained intermittent encephalopathy • infants, children and selected adults with two or more unexplained CNS handicaps • infants, children and selected adults with unexplained growth retardation or failure to thrive • any age individual with unexplained fasting intolerance • any age individual with unexplained exercise intolerance. Disorders of organic acid metabolism have various clinical presentations and ages of onset. Common presentations include an acute life-threatening illness in early infancy or unexplained developmental delay with intercurrent episodes of metabolic decompensation in later childhood. Clinical presentations in the teenage years or even later are also described. The mitochondrial fatty acid beta-oxidation disorders and disorders of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation can similarly present very early in life, in childhood, or in the adult years. Some of the common presentations include lethargy, fasting intolerance, myalgias, myopathy, exercise intolerance, cardiomyopathy and various types of developmental or neurological disability such as seizures or vision deficit. Some of the common clinical laboratory indications for ordering a urinary organic acid analysis include evaluation of: • neonates with unexplained moderate or marked ketonuria • neonates, infants, children and selected adults with unexplained anion gap acidosis • neonates, infants, children and selected adults with unexplained hyperammonemia • neonates, infants, children and selected adults with unexplained hypoglycemia • neonates, infants, children and selected adults with unexplained lactic acidemia In general, the genetic disorders detected by urinary organic acid analysis present at some time during infancy or childhood, often in the context of significant catabolic stresses such as an illness with vomiting, diarrhea and/or fever or fasting. Presentations during young adult years are also often prompted by illness, fasting or marked exercise and are commonly intermittent. 9500 Euclid Avenue | Cleveland, Ohio 44195 | 216.444.5755 | 800.628.6816 | clevelandcliniclabs.com Cleveland Clinic Laboratories Results and/or Interpretation The interpretation of the urinary organic acid analysis is based on: (1) age-related levels of the urinary organic acids; (2) patterns of the abnormally elevated organic acids; and (3) any pertinent negative findings (for example, the absence of an elevated urinary level of certain organic acids in the context of others that are elevated). An abnormal urinary organic acid analysis is usually not sufficient to conclusively establish a diagnosis of a particular genetic metabolic disorder. We strongly recommend having additional confirmatory testing. The latter is often done using enzyme-based assays (of blood, cultured cells, tissue biopsy) or by molecular genetic analysis of particular genes. The choice of confirmatory assay depends on the particular disorder that is suspected. Methodology The urinary organic acids are extracted from urine by organic solvent extraction and then identified and quantified by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry.

Methionine is the precursor of S-adenosylmethionine, which acts as a methyl donor to molecules such as nucleic acids and proteins in many essential physiological reactions. Polymorphisms in MTHFR that result in missense sequence changes and decreased enzyme activity are linked to hyperhomocysteinemia. Two commonly recognized polymorphic variants in the MTHFR gene are (1) the “thermolabile” c.665C->T (p.Ala222Val), historically referred to as c.677C->T, and (2) c.1286A->C (p.Glu429Ala), also known as c.1298A->C. Hyperhomocysteinemia is related to increased risks in many medical conditions, including but not limited to, venous thromboembolism, coronary heart disease, acute myocardial infarction, peripheral artery disease, stroke, aneurysm, migraine, hypertension, male infertility, risk for offspring with neural tube defect and recurrent pregnancy loss. The frequency of the MTHFR polymorphic variants is subject to considerable ethnic and geographic variation (higher in Caucasian/Hispanics and lower in African Americans). Between 40-50% of individuals of Northern European ancestry have MTHFR c.665C->T and/or c.1286A->C polymorphic variants. It is estimated that >25% of Hispanics and 10-15% of North American Caucasians are homozygous for “thermolabile” variant, and 8-20% of North American Caucasians are homozygous for c.665C->T variant. Clinicians may request testing for MTHFR polymorphisms to evaluate a patient’s risk of thrombophilia and other complications under certain circumstances. Reduced enzyme activity of MTHFR caused by MTHFR polymorphisms is a genetic risk factor for increased levels of homocysteine, especially in the presence of low serum folate. However, hyperhomocysteinemia may be caused by other genetic and physiologic factors and environmental influences rather than MTHFR gene activity alone. Serum enzymes with vitamin B cofactors such as vitamin B6, vitamin B12 and folate are associated with regulation of homocysteine levels. Many recent studies have indicated a lack of statistical evidence to support the association between the above-mentioned medical conditions and the two common MTHFR polymorphisms. Even when a homozygous “thermolabile” variant, c.665C->T, is identified in individuals, the absolute clinical risks are likely low. Because MTHFR polymorphisms account for only a fraction of the overall clinical picture, the utility of testing MTHFR polymorphisms is currently ambiguous, genetic counseling for test results is very difficult, and the test should be ordered and interpreted with caution. A basal plasma homocysteine, vitamin B12, vitamin B6, and folic acid levels should be measured in patients with suspected hyperhomocysteinemia. Plasma homocysteine levels may increase with age and are decreased in pregnant women. Patients who have normal plasma homocysteine level can be reassured that there is currently no evidence of increased risk for venous thromboembolism or recurrent pregnancy loss related to their MTHFR status. Patients who have elevated homocysteine and the MTHFR c.665C->T and/or c.1286A->C mutations, however, may be at mildly increased risk for both venous thromboembolism (odds ratio 1.27) and recurrent pregnancy loss (pooled risk 2.7). Genetic consultation and counseling of potentially affected family members regarding MTHFR mutation analysis is suggested. In patients without MTHFR c.665C->T and/or c.1286A->C mutations, elevated homocysteine levels may be related to acquired conditions such as deficiency of vitamin B12, vitamin B6 or folic acid, chronic renal failure, zinc deficiency, certain malignancies (e.g., leukemia) or antifolate therapy. Clinical Indications MTHFR c.665C->T and c.1286A->C mutation analysis is indicated in patients with venous thromboembolism, coronary heart disease, acute myocardial infarction, peripheral artery disease, stroke, aneurysm, hypertension and recurrent pregnancy loss with elevated basal plasma homocysteine levels. Interpretation The reference value is negative for the MTHFR c.665C->T and c.1286A->C mutations. The report will include interpretation of results (not detected, heterozygous, homozygous or compound heterozygous MTHFR c.665C->T and/or c.1286A>C), assay information, limitations and references based on the test results. Limitations of the Assay The MTHFR c.665C->T and c.1286A->C mutational analysis does not detect any other sequence changes in the MTHFR or other genes that may cause elevated homocysteine levels. Cardiovascular disease and venous thrombosis are multifactorial disorders, and other causes of these disorders are not excluded by this test. The MTHFR c.665C->T and c.1286A->C mutational analysis in an asymptomatic family member with normal homocysteine level is not useful. 9500 Euclid Avenue | Cleveland, Ohio 44195 | 216.444.5755 | 800.628.6816 | clevelandcliniclabs.com Cleveland Clinic Laboratories In individuals who have a known genetic risk factor for thrombophilia, such as factor V Leiden or prothrombin c.*97G>A, most available studies indicate that MTHFR genotype status does not alter thrombotic risk to a clinically significant degree. The American College of Medical Genetics 2013 Practice Guideline references the limited clinical utility of MTHFR polymorphism testing, therefore this testing should not be ordered as a part of a routine evaluation for thrombophilia or recurrent pregnancy loss. Methodology A solid-phase electrochemical method (Genmark eSensor® Thrombophilia Risk Test Kit and Genmark XT-8 instrument, Carlsbad, CA) is used for the detection MTHFR c.665C->T and c.1286A->C variants. The method includes multiplex PCR with patient’s genomic DNA and hybridization with allele-specific oligonucleotide signal probes labeled with a genotype-specific ferrocene derivative. Products are loaded into an electrode-bound cartridge, leading to generation of specific electronic signals from the allele-specific signal probes, and results are measured by voltammetry.

The APTT measures the integrity of the intrinsic and common pathways of the coagulation cascade. The prothrombin time (PT), another common screening test, measures the integrity of the extrinsic and common coagulation pathway. The APTT is measured as the number of seconds for the patient’s plasma to form a fibrin clot after the addition of an intrinsic pathway activator, phospholipid and calcium. A prolonged APTT can be caused by a coagulation factor deficiency or the presence of an inhibitor. The mixing study, incubated APTT, is used to investigate the cause of a prolonged APTT result. The mixing study is performed by measuring the APTT in the patient’s plasma, then mixing an equal volume of the patient’s plasma and normal pooled plasma (NPP) and repeating the APTT tests immediately and after one-hour incubation. The components of the panel include PT screen, APTT screen, APTT Immediate Mix and APTT Incubated Mix, as well as a thrombin time and heparin anti-Xa assay, if needed. The principle of the mixing study can be summarized as: 1. If the prolonged APTT screen is due to a factor deficiency, mixing with an equal volume of NPP, which has approximately 100% of all coagulation factors, will replace the patient’s deficient factor. This result in an APTT immediate mix is shortened or corrected into the reference range. 2. If the prolonged APTT screen is due to the presence of an inhibitor, mixing with an equal volume of NPP will not shorten or correct the prolongation of APTT in repeated tests. The reason is the inhibitor in the patient’s plasma is present in excess and binds to coagulation factors or protein/phospholipid complexes in both the patient’s plasma and NPP. Correction of the APTT in the mixing study suggests a coagulation factor deficiency in either the intrinsic pathway (factors VIII, IX, XI and XII, high-molecular-weight kininogen [HMWK] or prekallikrein [PK]), or in the common pathway (also prolonged PT) such as factor II, V and X. Deficiency of factors VIII, IX, and XI will present with bleeding, however, deficiency of factor XII, or prekallikrein will not increase bleeding risk, but may increase thrombotic risk. Further testing, such as clotting factor assays, is necessary to diagnose a specific factor deficiency. See Figure 1 for the diagnostic algorithm used in the laboratory. There are three different types of inhibitors: 1. Inhibitors directly against specific factors such as factor VIII or factor V inhibitors, 2. Anticoagulants such as heparins, fondaparinux, dabigatran and other direct thrombin inhibitors, and 3. Non-specific inhibitors such as lupus anticoagulants. Some inhibitors will demonstrate a delayed type inhibitor pattern, with time and/or temperature dependence. In cases with a delayed type inhibitor, the APTT Immediate Mix will correct to within the reference range, however, the APTT Incubated Mix will be prolonged. Although rare, the presence of a factor inhibitor, such as a factor VIII inhibitor, will increase the risk of life-threatening bleeding. The presence of a factor inhibitor can be confirmed by a Bethesda assay for that factor. The presence of heparins, fondaparinux, dabigatran or other direct thrombin inhibitors can cause prolongation of both the APTT Immediate Mix and APTT Incubated Mix. Careful clinical and medication history, and additional thrombin time with heparin assay (anti-Xa inhibition assay) can exclude the presence of anticoagulants. The presence of lupus anticoagulants, which are antibodies against protein-phospholipid complexes, will increase the 9500 Euclid Avenue | Cleveland, Ohio 44195 | 216.444.5755 | 800.628.6816 | clevelandcliniclabs.com risk of thromboembolism. The presence of low level nonspecific inhibitors in the patient’s plasma may demonstrate a prolonged APTT Incubated Mix similar to a delayed type inhibitor. If the clinical history suggests a lupus anticoagulant, further testing including phospholipid based screening tests, phospholipid dependency assays, and exclusion of the presence of inhibitors, in addition to mixing study, incubated APTT, is necessary (see diagnostic algorithm for lupus anticoagulant). The adequate performance of the mixing test and accurate interpretation is important because the presence of a specific factor inhibitor, non-specific inhibitor such as lupus anticoagulant, anticoagulants or factor deficiency have different clinical manifestations and require different clinical management. Clinical Indications The mixing test, incubated APTT, is indicated when the cause of a prolonged APTT result needs to be investigated. Interpretation 1. If the APTT Screen is prolonged with a normal APTT Immediate Mix and APTT Incubated mix, this indicates a factor deficiency in the intrinsic or final common pathway. If the PT is normal, this suggests an intrinsic pathway deficiency (VIII, IX, XI, XII, PK, HMWK). If the PT is prolonged, this suggests a common pathway deficiency (fibrinogen, II, V, X). 2. If the APTT Screen is prolonged, with a normal APTT Immediate Mix, but an abnormal APTT Incubated Mix, this indicates the presence of a delayed inhibitor such as specific factor inhibitors, most commonly factor VIII inhibitor, and small numbers of lupus anticoagulant. 3. If the APTT Screen is prolonged, with an abnormal APTT Immediate Mix and abnormal APTT Incubated Mix, this favors a non-specific inhibitor such as a lupus anticoagulant, and anticoagulants such as heparin, fondaparinux, dabigatran or other direct thrombin inhibitors. Methodology The PT Screen is performed using Innovin® (Dade Behring, Inc.) reagent and STAR Evolution® Analyzer (Diagnostica Stago, Inc.). The PT Screen is included to localize abnormalities to common, intrinsic and extrinsic pathway. The APTT Screen is performed using the PTT-Automate reagent and STAR Evolution® analyzer (both Diagnostica Stago, Inc). The mixing studies are performed by mixing the patient’s plasma with an equal volume of the NPP (Cryocheck; Precision Biologic, Inc). For the APTT Immediate Mix, the APTT is performed immediately after mixing the plasmas. For the APTT Incubated Mix, the APTT is performed after one-hour incubation at 37ºC. The NPP serves as a negative control; two levels of positive control are performed; lupus positive plasma (Precision Biologic, Inc) and weak lupus positive plasma (Precision Biologic, Inc). The thrombin time (Diagnostica Stago, Inc) will be measured in specimens with prolonged APTT. If the TT is prolonged, a heparin assay (anti-Xa inhibition assay; Rotachrom Heparin kit, Diagnostica Stago, Inc.) by a chromogenic assay will be performed to distinguish a heparin effect from a direct thrombin inhibitor. Specimen Collection and Handling Discontinue coumadin therapy for 14 days; direct thrombin inhibitors, fondaparinux and heparin 2 days prior to collection. The presence of heparin, fondaparinux, dabigatron or other direct thrombin inhibitor in the specimen may interfere with test results. Blood should be collected by routine venipuncture in a 3.5mL light blue top tube containing 9:1 ratio of blood to 3.2% trisodium citrate anticoagulant. Pediatric volume of 2.5mL with an appropriate ratio of anticoagulant is acceptable. Specimens improperly collected, stored, misidentified or of insufficient volume are unacceptable.

Microsatellite instability (MSI) is characterized by alterations in the length of these sequences. It indicates a failure to repair certain errors during DNA replication and serves as a marker of a deficiency in at least one of the DNA mismatch repair proteins. Combined analysis of MSI and immunohistochemistry (IHC) for DNA MMR protein expression provides a sensitive and specific method for identifying tumors with defects in the DNA mismatch repair complex. In 2009, the Evaluation of Genomic Applications in Practice and Prevention recommended that all colorectal cancers undergo MSI and/or IHC testing.2 At Cleveland Clinic, all surgically resected colorectal cancers (except those related to inflammatory bowel disease or polyposis) undergo MSI testing. Clinical Indications Lynch Syndrome Screening Lynch syndrome (LS), which is also known as hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC) is an autosomal dominant hereditary cancer syndrome that predisposes patients to colorectal, uterine, gastric, ovarian and other tumors. It is caused by germline mutations in the mismatch repair genes MLH1, MSH2, MSH6 and PMS2, as well as germline deletions in EPCAM. At least 90% of Lynch syndrome patients can be detected through MMR testing (MSI or IHC). In 1999, the Amsterdam II Criteria were published (see below) to identify individuals who may have Lynch syndrome1: • Three or more family members diagnosed with an HNPCC-related cancer (colorectal, endometrial, stomach, small intestine, hepatobiliary, renal pelvic or ureteral), one of whom is a first-degree relative of the other two Prognostic/Predictive Role In the landmark study by Ribic et al3, patients with stage II and stage III colorectal carcinomas were stratified according to MSI status and randomized to 5-FU chemotherapy or surgery alone. As the table below shows, there is significantly better five-year survival in MSI-High carcinoma. It also reveals loss of this survival advantage when patients with MSI-High carcinomas receive 5-FU. Survival in Colorectal Carcinoma According to MSI and 5-FU treatment No 5-FU 5-year survival 5-FU 5-year survival MSI-High 88% 71% MSI-Stable/MSI-Low 68% 76% 0.004 0.66 P-value Accordingly, the National Comprehensive Cancer Care Network (NCCN) recommends MMR testing should also be considered for all patients with stage II disease.4 Interpretation • Two successive affected generations MSI-high (MSI-H): The neoplasm exhibits instability in at least two of the five microsatellites analyzed. • One or more of the HNPCC-related cancers diagnosed before age 50 years MSI-low (MSI-L): The neoplasm exhibits instability at only one microsatellite locus. 9500 Euclid Avenue | Cleveland, Ohio 44195 | 216.444.5755 | 800.628.6816 | clevelandcliniclabs.com Microsatellite stable (MSS): The neoplasm exhibits no alterations in any of the microsatellites tested. Note: All lesions classified as MSI-H undergo immunohistochemistry for MLH1 and MSH2 because one of these two proteins are implicated in the vast majority of MSI-H carcinomas. If MLH1 is lost, then BRAF V600E mutation testing is undertaken; see BRAF Technical Brief for additional information. If MLH1 and MSH2 are normally expressed in the carcinoma nuclei, then IHC for PMS2 and MSH6 are tested. Limitations of the Assay Both MSI and IHC are imperfectly sensitive for the detection of LS/HNPCC; however MSI is slightly more sensitive (≈ 5%) than IHC because not all proteins in the DNA MMR complex can be tested by IHC and non-functional proteins may be antigenically detectable by IHC. MSI requires a relatively pure sample of tumor, and we aim for at least 50% tumor cells to be confident in the results of the analysis. A pathologist screens the slide(s) and carefully marks the most dense area of tumor for microdissection in the lab. Borderline cases (about 25-50%) will be backed up by IHC, and cases with scant carcinoma cells (less than about 25%) will only receive IHC testing. IHC in the evaluation of MMR suffers from capricious staining. Both false positive and false negative results are well-documented in the literature. Loss of expression is only interpreted if the internal positive control cells (non-lesional inflammatory cells, normal epithelium or mesenchyme) retain their normal nuclear expression. In order to reduce opportunities for diagnostic errors as well as because of the slightly reduced sensitivity of IHC, Cleveland Clinic prefers to use the IHC tests as a followup to MSI testing or a backup to technically challenging cases. Methodology DNA is extracted from the paraffin-embedded neoplastic tissue sections and from separate non-neoplastic paraffin-embedded tissue sections or a blood sample from the patient. PCR amplification is performed using an MSI multiplex system, which includes five mononucleotide markers (BAT 25, BAT 26, NR 21, NR 24, and MONO 27) in addition to two pentanucleotide markers to confirm sample identity (Penta C and Penta D). The PCR products are analyzed by capillary gel electrophoresis. By comparing the sizes of the PCR products from normal and abnormal samples, the presence of MSI is determined by the appearance of new alleles in the lesional sample that are not present in the corresponding normal sample. This system meets the recommendations proposed at the 2002 National Cancer Institute’s workshop on HNPCC and MSI testing.6 References 1. Vasen HF, Watson P, Mecklin JP, Lynch HT.

The drug’s initial FDA-approved indication was for adjunctive therapy of partial-onset seizures in adults, but additional indications have been subsequently approved. It has excellent oral bioavailability (>95%) and is renally excreted, with 66% of the drug present in urine unchanged, and 24% present as the primary metabolite, which is pharmacologically inactive. Hepatic metabolism of the drug has not been demonstrated, so changes in cytochrome P450 expression levels and activities, as well as interactions with other drugs, are unlikely. Plasma half-life of levetiracetam in otherwise healthy individuals is 6-8 hours. Serum or plasma specimens may be stored up to one week refrigerated; if testing is delayed beyond one week, specimens may be stored frozen up to four weeks. To optimize individual patient care, specimens from the same matrix should be used for tracking and/or result comparisons. Interference by other anti-epileptic drugs and the primary metabolite of levetiracetam (ucbL057) was evaluated by the immunoassay manufacturer and found to be minimal. High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) of extracted samples has been available as a monitoring methodology for several years. In 2009, a 510(k) FDA-cleared, homogeneous immunoassay for levetiracetam monitoring in serum and plasma was introduced, with advantages that include reduced turnaround time and sample preparation, leading to potential improvements in patient care. Clinical Indications Although levetiracetam is recognized for its ease of dosing and tolerability, monitoring serum/plasma concentrations may be indicated in patients with conditions that often alter pharmacokinetic characteristics, such as renal impairment, pregnancy, or older age. Monitoring also may be useful to optimize regimens in individual patients, to guide dosing in newer extended-release formulations, or to investigate therapeutic failure or compliance. Interpretation Results are reported in units of μg/mL (micrograms/mL). The Lab Test and Diagnostic Procedure Handbook (Lexi-Comp) reports a therapeutic range of 5-45 μg/mL (approx 29-265 μmol/L) when levels are obtained to evaluate for poor clinical response, signs of toxicity, onset of seizures, changes in concurrent medication, or suspected noncompliance. Methodology The levetiracetam immunoassay (ARK Diagnostics, Sunnyvale, Calif.) was adapted for use on the ADVIA 1200 automated chemistry analyzer (Siemens Healthcare Diagnostics, Deerfield, Ill.). This platform allows for random access analysis and small sample volumes. The immunoassay is homogeneous and utilizes an antibody against levetiracetam. The reagents include levetiracetam labeled with the enzyme glucose6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH), which competes with analyte from the patient specimen for binding to the antibody. Antibody binding to the labeled drug-enzyme complex reduces the enzyme activity. Increased concentration of drug from the patient specimen, therefore, results in increased activity of (unbound) drug-enzyme complex. The reaction converts NAD to NADH, which is monitored spectrophotometrically. A method comparison between the new immunoassay and HPLC-UV as a reference method was carried out using leftover specimens from patients on levetiracetam therapy. As illustrated in figure 1, the immunoassay correlated very well with the HPLC-UV data (slope=0.982, r=.9965, n=63 samples). Related Tests Assays for monitoring many other anti-epileptic drugs are available and may be ordered in conjunction with levetiracetam concentration.

The incidence of nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) infections is increasing, and NTM isolates now are more common in the United States than M. tuberculosis. Strict isolation is required under Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines for all patients suspected of having tuberculosis; isolation is not required for patients infected with NTM.

While occurring in only two to three cases per 100,000 people in North America, glioblastoma represents 52% of all functional tissue brain tumor cases and 20% of all intracranial tumors. Prognosis for those diagnosed with glioblastoma is poor, with a median survival time of about 14 months.1 Patients with glioblastoma can be treated with alkylating agents such as Temador® (temozolomide). Epigenetic silencing of the MGMT (O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase) DNA-repair gene by promoter methylation compromises DNA repair and has been associated with longer survival in patients with glioblastoma who receive temozolomide.2,3 Temozolomide kills tumor cells by producing cross-links between DNA strands and inhibiting DNA replication. The most common alkylation site is the O6 position of guanine. O6-methylguanine DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) is a DNA repair protein that reverses such DNA alkylation and confers chemoresistance by repairing DNA damage. Temozolomide seems to work by sensitizing the tumor cells to radiation.4 Recent clinical studies confirm that the presence of MGMT promoter methylation in tumor samples corresponds to an increased likelihood that tumor cells would be responsive to temozolomide.3,4,5,6 If the promotor was methylated, temozolomide was more effective. It is estimated that approximately 40 to 50% of glioblastoma tumors exhibit MGMT gene methylation, which correlates significantly with reduced DNA damage repair induced by alkylating agents and significantly enhanced chemosensitivity.4 According to recent clinical trials, glioblastoma patients with MGMT methylation respond to temozolomide two to three times better than those lacking of MGMT methylation. Prolonged overall and progression-free survival at 24 months was 80% for those with MGMT methylation vs. 20% for those lacking MGMT methylation. Diagnostic MGMT testing requires sufficient and optimally preserved tumor tissue. Cleveland Clinic’s MGMT methylation assay is a new, quantitative MSP test to detect the methylation status of brain tissue that has undergone thorough clinical evaluation. Our protocol calls for a minimal tissue sample size of ½-centimeter, which is much smaller than other laboratories that typically require at least a minimum 1-centimeter sample size. The best results are obtained with cryopreserved tumor specimens. Clinical Indications For patients diagnosed with glioblastoma to determine if a methylated MGMT promoter is present, which is a favorable prognostic indicator for temozolomide treatment. Individuals without a methylated MGMT promoter do not have such a benefit. MGMT “silence” is the most significant guide for the treatment of glioblastoma.This assay is to validate the methylation status of the MGMT gene. Methodology Pyrosequencing technology, which is based on the principle of sequencing by synthesis, provides quantitative data in sequence context within minutes. Real-time sequence information is highly suitable for quantification of CpG methylation. We have validated pyrosequencing-based assay in detection of MGMT methylation in paraffin-embeded biopsy tissue specimens. With 10% average methylation as a cutoff, MGMT promoter methylation was detected in glioblastoma, but not detected in non-neoplastic brain tissue. The analytical sensitivity of the assay is 5% of target cells harboring MGMT methylation. Diagnostic MGMT testing requires sufficient and optimally preserved tumor tissue. The biopsy should be at least 0.5 cm in size and necrosis should be less than 15%. Both frozen and paraffin-embedded tissue are suitable for the pyrosequencingbased MGMT methylation assay. 9500 Euclid Avenue | Cleveland, Ohio 44195 | 216.444.5755 | 800.628.6816 | clevelandcliniclabs.com Cleveland Clinic Laboratories Interpretation Positive for MGMT methylation: equal or greater than 10% of methylation in any CpG island or in average of all CpG islands analyzed.

It contains two cross-linked proteins as part of its structure: apolipoprotein(a) covalently bound to apolipoprotein B-100. Lp(a) is important as a serum marker for coronary artery disease independent of diet and lipid levels. Elevated Lp(a) levels are associated with increased risk and severity of atherosclerosis, coronary heart disease and stroke. For the most accurate results, wait at least two months after a heart attack, surgery, stroke, infection, injury, or pregnancy to check blood level. In general, lipids should not be measured right after excessive alcohol intake, with severely uncontrolled diabetes, or during rapid weight loss. Similar to LDL-cholesterol, Lp(a) is synthesized in the liver. Although Lp(a) shows some homology to LDL-cholesterol in structure, Lp(a) differs from LDL in molecular weight, electrophoretic mobility and protein/lipid ratio. Physiologic circulating levels of Lp(a) do not appear to be regulated by the same mechanisms of LDL-cholesterol. Likewise, cholesterol feeding does not appear to increase levels of Lp(a) in plasma, although it does increase levels of LDLcholesterol. Most pharmacologic agents that have an effect on lowering LDL-cholesterol levels have little effect on levels of Lp(a), thus also indicating regulation under different metabolic control. The causes of high Lp(a) are kidney disease and certain family (genetic) lipid disorders. Clinical Indications Patients with a family history of elevated Lp(a) and/or a family history of premature cardiovascular disease that is not explained by high LDL or low HDL. Also used for heart disease patients with a normal lipid profile and mildly elevated cholesterol and/or low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), as it is believed that an elevated Lp(a) may worsen other heart and vascular disease processes. An elevated Lp(a) may suggest the need for more aggressive treatment of LDL and other, more treatable risk factors down to acceptable levels. Methodology Lipoprotein (a) in serum is quantitatively measured on the Immage 800 Immunochemistry system by rate nephelometry. Antibody to human Lp(a) is brought into contact with Lp(a) in a sample. The IMMAGE 800 Test measures the rate of increase in light scattered from particles suspended in solution as a result of complexes formed during an antigen-antibody reaction. The increase in light scatter resulting from the antigen-antibody reaction is converted to a peak rate signal, which is a function of the sample Lp(a) concentration. Following calibration, the peak rate signal for a particular assay is automatically converted to concentration units by the analyzer. References 1.

Diagnostic delay also may result in increased mortality. Target sequences within the genes that encode the 5S and 16S ribosomal subunits, as well as the mip (macrophage infectivity potentiator) gene, in conjunction with real-time PCR are useful for the detection of the Legionella genus and, specifically, the species L. pneumophila. Multiple laboratory methods should be employed to ensure the diagnosis of Legionnaire’s disease (LD), a bacterial pneumonia caused by L. pneumophila (90% of cases) or other Legionella species. Molecular methods are more sensitive than culture for the diagnosis of LD. The PCR assay performed at Cleveland Clinic will not detect disease caused by Legionella species other than L. pneumophila. Culture for Legionella species from respiratory sites is a sensitive (~80-90%) method for diagnosing severe, untreated disease, but insensitive (~20%) for the diagnosis of mild disease. Specimens from nonrespiratory sites should not be submitted for Legionella culture unless there is a high index of clinical suspicion to support the request. Urine antigen assays for L. pneumophila serogroup 1 will be positive in ~90-95% of patients with severe disease due to the Pontiac monoclonal subtype of serogroup 1, but positive in only 50% of these patients with mild disease. The urine antigen assay is unreliable for the diagnosis of severe LD caused by L. pneumophila other than serogroup 1 or a different Legionella species (detects less than 5-40% of cases). The mip gene, which encodes a 24-kDa protein virulence factor that facilitates the entry of legionellae into amoebae and macrophages, has sufficient sequence variability between the Legionella species to allow for the specific detection of L. pneumophila by real-time PCR.

The LightCycler FastStart DNA Master Hybridization Probe Kit (Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, Ind.) is used in conjunction with species-specific Legionella pneumophila primers and probes. The PCR is performed on the LightCycler system (Roche). Qualitative positive and negative results are determined based on analysis of the amplification curves and post-amplification melt curve. Limitations of the Assay This assay does not contain an internal amplification control. Instead, the false-negative rate, which to date has been 0%, is monitored according to College of American Pathologists guidelines. Legionella species other than L. pneumophila infrequently cause legionellosis. This assay only detects L. pneumophila. The implementation of this test was intended to replace the less sensitive direct immunofluorescence assay, and it is intended to be used in conjunction with culture.

Recently, two EGFR inhibitors, cetuximab and panitumumab, have been FDA-approved for the treatment of metastatic colorectal carcinoma. Unfortunately, only a small minority of patients will respond. Mutations in KRAS codons 12 and 13 are associated with lack of response to EGFR-targeted therapies in both CRC and NSCLC patients.3 These results have convinced the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO),9 the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN),10 and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to recommend KRAS mutation testing prior to receiving treatment with anti-EGFR monoclonal antibodies. Since KRAS mutations occur in about 30-40% of colorectal cancer, KRAS mutation testing has tremendous cost/healthcare resource-saving potential. However, recently published guidelines for NSCLC testing for the Association of advanced NSCLC who are being considered for treatment with an EGFR antagonist. This test detects mutations in the KRAS gene, thereby determining eligibility for therapies targeting epidermal growth factor receptors (EGFR). Cleveland Clinic tests Stage 4 (distant metastasis) colorectal cancers for KRAS mutations in codons 12/13. Excellent concordance has been demonstrated between primary and metastatic samples such that either primary or metastasis may be tested.11 The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has approved this test to identify patients with colorectal cancer for treatment with Erbitux® (cetuximab) and Vectibix® (panitumumab) based on a KRAS result of no mutation identified with the Therascreen® KRAS RGQ PCR Kit and Therascreen® KRAS Assay Package Software analysis.

Based on the predetermined analytical values, the therascreen KRAS software package qualitatively determines and reports the mutation status. In the rare instance of a tumor containing more than one KRAS mutation, only one mutation is identified and reported by the software. Results are reported as positive (homozygous or heterozygous for the mutation detected) or negative. Interpretation The presence of a KRAS mutation in codon 12 or 13 is associated with a high likelihood of resistance to therapies important loci such as KRAS codons 59, 61, 117, 146 or NRAS codons 12, 13, 59, 61, 117, 146 are not tested using this assay. Detection of the mutation is dependent on sample integrity and the amount of amplifiable DNA present in the specimen. The methods used in this assay are highly selected and, depending on the total amount of DNA present, can detect approximately 1% to 5% of mutant DNA in a background of wild-type genomic DNA. In small specimens with wild-type results, a short disclaimer will often be added to suggest that a false negative result is a possibility. References 1. Siegel R, Naishadham D, Jemal A.

Several cytogenetic and/or molecular abnormalities define distinct clinical entities that are associated with differences in prognosis. For example, acute myeloid leukemias containing the core-binding factor (CBF) translocations, t(8;21)(q22;q22) and inv(16)(p13q22) are recognized as distinct neoplasms with characteristic clinical and morphologic features and an overall favorable prognosis.1 Mutations in the KIT gene are identified in approximately 20-40% of CBF acute myeloid leukemias. Mutations consist predominantly of point mutations in exon 17 or, less frequently, insertions and deletions occurring in exon 8. The presence of a KIT mutation is reported to abrogate the favorable prognosis associated with CBF acute leukemias, especially t(8;21).2-4 The identification of KIT mutations in CBF leukemias assists in prognostic assessment and selection of appropriate therapy, and KIT mutation analysis is recommended for risk stratification of CBF leukemias in current National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines.5 The Cleveland Clinic Department of Molecular Pathology has developed, validated and implemented a sequencing assay for the detection of mutations in KIT exons 8 and 17.

One of these disorders, chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), is defined by the presence of a BCR-ABL1 translocation, but specific, disease-defining molecular genetic abnormalities for the other typical MPNs (primary myelofibrosis, essential thrombocythemia and polycythemia vera) have not been identified. Therefore, diagnosis has relied on a constellation of clinical and pathologic features as well as exclusion of other specific genetic abnormalities such as BCR-ABL1 translocation. 1. The analytical sensitivity of the assay is approximately 2% mutant alleles. Thus, lower level involvement of the sample (either blood granulocytes or bone marrow) may not be detected, and repeat testing at a later date may be helpful in selected patients. Recent studies have shown that a significant number of patients diagnosed with non-CML MPNs have an acquired mutation in JAK2 (c.1849G>T p.V617F). Estimates of the frequency are variable with the highest percentages seen in polycythemia vera (> 95% of cases). A lower, but still substantial percentage of essential thrombocythemia (40-50%) and primary myelofibrosis (50%) cases also harbor this mutation. JAK2 V617F is either not found or is extremely uncommon in other disorders such as typical CML, myelodysplastic syndromes, acute leukemias without prior MPNs, acute lymphoblastic leukemias, and chronic lymphocytic leukemia.1-9 Clinical Indications Suspected non-CML myeloproliferative neoplasms or overlap myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative diseases. Interpretation The test result is reported as JAK2 V617F mutation present or absent. In positive cases, the relative mutation burden is also reported in semi-quantitative fashion (i.e., mutant represents minority of detectable alleles vs. mutant represents majority of detectable alleles). The presence of the JAK2 V617F mutation representing a majority of detectable JAK2 alleles is consistent with a bi-allelic mutation. 2. Since the mutation is not disease-specific, correlation with other clinical and laboratory findings is required for subclassification of disease type in the event of a positive (mutation detected) result. 3. Absence of the mutation does not exclude the presence of a myeloproliferative neoplasm. Methodology JAK2 V617F mutation analysis is performed using a semi-quantitative, TaqMan allelic discrimination assay (Ipsogen, Marseille, France): 1. DNA is isolated from peripheral blood, bone marrow, or formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue. 2. PCR for the region of interest is performed, and mutant vs wild type alleles are discriminated using a FAM labeled mutant specific probe and a VIC labeled wild type specific probe. 3. The ratio of mutant to wild type JAK2 is calculated and compared to control samples containing 2%, 50% or 100% mutant alleles. References 1. Swerdlow SH, Campo E, Harris NL, et al (Eds).

JAK2 exon 12-15 is amplified by PCR, and the PCR product is subjected to bidirectional cycle sequencing using the BigDye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Kit (Applied Biosystems, Carlsbad, CA) on the ABI 3730 Genetic Analyzer. Sequences are aligned to wild type reference sequence and assessed for the presence of mutations. A subset of polycythemia vera patients, however, lack the typical V617F mutation and instead contain other mutations elsewhere in the JAK2 pseudokinase domain. The majority of these alternative mutations occur in exon 12, but these may also be found in exons 13 through 15.7-9 The finding of an acquired mutation in JAK2 exons 12-15 supports the diagnosis of a myeloproliferative neoplasm, especially polycythemia vera. Therefore, the Department of Molecular Pathology at Cleveland Clinic, has developed, validated and implemented a sequencing assay for the detection of mutations in JAK2 exons 12-15. Clinical Indications JAK2 exon 12-15 mutation analysis is useful in the evaluation of suspected myeloproliferative disorders, especially polycythemia vera, that lack the common JAK2 V617F point mutation. Note: For more sensitive detection of the JAK2 V617F mutation, please order JAK2 V617F mutation detection. Interpretation Normal results are reported as “JAK2 exon 12-15 mutations are not detected.” Positive results are reported using Human Genome Variation Society (HGVS) nomenclature, and an interpretation provided. Limitations of the Assay The lower limit of reliable mutation detection is 15-20% mutant alleles. Formalin-fixed, paraffin embedded tissue is not accepted. References 1.

Maternal colonization of the genitourinary or gastrointestinal tracts is the most important risk factor for intrapartum transmission of GBS to the newborn. Approximately 10-30% of women will be colonized.8 In the 1990’s implementation of prophylaxis for GBS administered during labor resulted in a decline in infections among newborns from 1.7 cases per 1,000 live births to 0.3 cases per 1,000 live births.6 Candidates for prophylaxis were defined by two risk categories. These groups were women with GBS identified in screening cultures collected at 35 to 37 weeks’ fetal gestation and women presenting in labor with risk factors including premature delivery, rupture of membranes or fever. In 2002, following a large population-based study, the CDC recommended universal screening at 35 to 37 weeks to identify colonized women who should receive intrapartum therapy.7 The CDC further recommended prophylaxis for women with unknown colonization status. In 2010 the CDC published a new guideline for prevention of perinatal GBS disease.2 This guideline recommends universal screening of pregnant women for GBS colonization at 35-37 weeks’ fetal gestation. Those presenting in labor who have not had routine prenatal testing may be tested for GBS during labor with the Cepheid GeneXpert PCR test. However, women with risk factors including delivery prior to 37 weeks gestation, premature rupture of membranes or fever ≥100ºF (≥38.0ºC) should be given prophylaxis for GBS during labor regardless of testing for GBS. The most recent CDC guidance describes sensitive methods for detection of GBS from vaginal-rectal swab specimens. All routine screening tests should include an enrichment broth step prior to detection by culture or polymerase chain reaction (PCR). However, when intrapartum testing is necessary, it is not feasible to include an enrichment broth step since it requires the broth to be incubated for 18 to 24 hours. In these cases a sensitive, direct rapid nucleic acid amplification test such as the PCR may be used, provided rapid results are available. Rapid turn-around-time is necessary to allow sufficient time for infusion of antibiotics prior to delivery.2 The Cepheid GeneXpert PCR test may be performed directly on vaginal-rectal swab specimens with results in about one hour.1 Compared to culture from enrichment broth, the GeneXpert PCR test was shown to be 91.5 to 98.5% sensitive in several studies.3-5 Although less sensitive than PCR performed from an enrichment broth, the direct PCR method has adequate sensitivity, a rapid turn-around-time, and is simple to perform, allowing testing to be performed seven days a week on any shift.2 Reporting and Interpretation • Results are reported as: • Negative for Group B Streptococcus by PCR. • Positive for Group B Streptococcus by PCR. • Invalid Result. Specimen inhibitory to amplification (see limitations). Limitations of the Assay • Intrapartum testing should not replace antepartum testing at 35–37 weeks’ gestation. • The use of collection devices other than the dual rayon swab in Stuart’s liquid transport medium is not recommended. Other specimen types have not been validated with the Xpert GBS test. • False negative results may occur if the number of organisms in the sample is below the limit of detection. • Test results may be affected by prior antibiotic therapy. • DNA from non-viable organisms may be detected. A positive result is presumptive for the presence of GBS. • Results of some specimens may be reported as “invalid” due to substances in the specimen that are inhibitory to PCR amplification. Invalid results are rare (<1%) of specimens. 9500 Euclid Avenue | Cleveland, Ohio 44195 | 216.444.5755 | 800.628.6816 | clevelandcliniclabs.com Cleveland Clinic Laboratories Methodology The Intrapartum Group B Streptococcus test is a rapid in vitro diagnostic test for the direct detection of Group B Streptococcus from vaginal-rectal swabs. Developed by Cepheid and marketed as the Xpert GBS test, this FDA-approved assay uses polymerase chain reaction (PCR) methodology to amplify DNA and real-time, fluorogenic probes to detect a target within a region adjacent to the cfb gene of GBS. An internal control is included to verify the absence of any inhibitors that would prevent PCR amplification. Test reagents are contained within an enclosed test cartridge. No additional reagents are added. Reaction steps, including DNA extraction, PCR amplification and detection, take place within the test cartridge. All testing and analysis occur exclusively on the Cepheid™ GeneXpert instrument.1 References 1. Package Insert: Xpert GBS. Cepheid, Sunnyvale, CA. 2011. 2.

Thrombophilia (or hypercoagulability), although not a disease itself, is a major contributing factor in the development of VTE. Thrombophilia is the propensity to develop thromboses due to an acquired or inherited defect in the coagulation system. The predominant clinical manifestation of thrombophilia is venous thromboembolism. Anti-phospholipid antibody syndrome (APS) is the most common cause of acquired thrombophilia. Additional causes include acquired or inherited deficiency of anticoagulant or procoagulant factors (e.g., protein C, protein S, antithrombin or fibrinogen), acquired or inherited elevation in procoagulant factors such as factor VIII or homocysteine (>95th percentile). Inherited genetic mutations including Factor V Leiden [FVL] and prothrombin gene also predispose to thrombosis. Not all abnormalities are associated with thrombophilia. For example, thrombophilic risk factors include advancing age (>50), major surgery, trauma, immobilization, malignancy, pregnancy, prior to oral contraceptive or hormonal replacement therapy, and chemotherapy. As with many disease-modifying risk factors, thrombophilic risk factors are synergistic — a combination magnifies the risk for thrombosis. Acquired fibrinogen deficiency can occur in liver disease, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) or hyperfibrinolysis. Acquired protein C or protein S deficiency can be associated with liver disease, anticoagulant therapy (warfarin), acute thrombosis, infections, DIC, postoperatively, uremia or chemotherapy. Acquired antithrombin deficiency can be associated with DIC, liver disease, heparin therapy, acute thrombosis, nephrotic syndrome, or L-asparaginase therapy. Currently, there is no single laboratory test that can identify all hypercoagulable defects. Therefore, a combination of laboratory analyses is needed to accurately identify thrombophilic patients. Many of these tests are affected by other — often concurrent — clinical conditions so that the correct interpretation of these specialized laboratory test results can be complicated and always require clinical correlation. Clinical Indications • Patients with a personal or family history of unexplained or recurrent thrombosis and/or pregnancy complications. • Potential benefit for screening patients who will be placed at increased risk of thrombosis. Interpretation • This panel of tests is not simply reported as positive or negative. A narrative interpretation is issued for each patient panel. • Each test is reported separately, taking into account the patient’s clinical context. • Each positive test result increases the relative risk of thrombophilia independently of the other test results. Limitations of the Assays Results from a hypercoagulability work-up are difficult to interpret in the setting of acute thrombosis or anticoagulant medication therapy; thus, testing should be performed approximately 30 days after VTE or discontinuation of medication including warfarin, heparin, direct thrombin inhibitors (DTIs) and fibrinolytic agents. Certain other clinical conditions (e.g. pregnancy, inflammatory states, liver disease, etc.) may affect certain assay results as well. The test requestor should provide appropriate clinical information in regards to these conditions to assist the laboratory in making the best possible interpretation of results. Alternatively, thrombophilic testing may be delayed until these clinical conditions have subsided. 9500 Euclid Avenue | Cleveland, Ohio 44195 | 216.444.5755 | 800.628.6816 | clevelandcliniclabs.com Certain more rare thrombophilic mutations do exist for which testing is not currently performed. In this case, a patient may have an apparently negative thrombophilic work-up while still exhibiting a thrombotic phenotype. Clinical judgment is necessary to guide the therapy of these patients. Methodology Laboratory testing for thrombophilia consists of a panel of assays specifically performed together to maximize diagnostic potential (see figure). • C-reactive protein: Levels assist in determining whether Factor VIII and fibrinogen are elevated as part of an acute phase response. Antigenic testing: • Specific antibodies against cardiolipin by ELISA assay. If positive, antibodies against ß2 glycoprotein 1 are measured. Functional testing: • Protein S (free and total) antigenic testing may be performed to confirm and/or subtype a deficiency detected by a decrease in protein S functional activity. • Anti-phospholipid antibody (APA, lupus anticoagulant): Automated and manual aPTT, and the hexagonal phase phospholipid dependence assay. • Protein C antigen level may be measured to confirm and/or subtype a deficiency detected by a decrease in protein C functional activity. • Protein S: A turbidometric clot-based assay. If a deficiency is suggested, an antigen level can be measured for confirmation. • Antithrombin antigen level may be measured to confirm and/or subtype a deficiency detected by a decrease in antithrombin functional activity. • Protein C and antithrombin: Chromogenic substrate assays in which the normal ability to cleave substrate molecules causes a color change. If a deficiency is suggested, an antigen level can be measured for confirmation. Genetic/Molecular testing: • Activated protein C resistance (APC; a surrogate for the FVL mutation): An aPTT-based assay using the ratio of APTTs with and without additional APC. If the ratio is decreased (<2), molecular testing is used as confirmation of FVL mutation. • Homocysteine levels: Chemiluminescence immunoassay. While the methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) gene mutation may be confirmed by molecular methods, this usually is considered unnecessary. • Fibrinogen: Clauss variation of the thrombin time assay (clot-based). • Factor VIII: Clot-based assay. • A single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in a regulatory region of the prothrombin gene (G20210A) accounts for most cases of elevated prothrombin. This SNP is assayed by fluorescence melt-curve analysis. • FVL may be confirmed (after a decreased APC-R result) by fluorescence melt-curve analysis. References 1. Colman RW et al.

Patients affected by PNH display complement mediated hemolysis, thrombosis and bone marrow failure though the clinical presentation is variable. The presence of a PNH clone occurs in classical hemolytic PNH, generally at levels above 1%; however, PNH clones may also be seen in other disorders such as aplastic anemia and myelodysplastic syndrome. Flow cytometric immunophenotypic analysis is the method of choice to detect populations of GPI anchor-deficient cells used in the diagnosis of PNH and to monitor patients with an established diagnosis.1 PNH erythrocyte clones may be divided into those with partial loss of CD59 (PNH Type II Cells) or complete loss of CD59 (PNH Type III Cells). Results of PNH flow cytometry studies must be interpreted in the context of the clinical, laboratory and histologic findings. Cleveland Clinic Laboratories now offers high sensitivity flow cytometry testing for PNH using whole blood. This procedure labels red blood cells (RBC) and white blood cells (WBC) for the detection of GPI-linked surface antigens using monoclonal antibodies and a fluorochrome labeled bacterial aerolysin (FLAER).2 Through high sensitivity flow cytometry testing, as few as 0.01% PNH cells can be detected.1 Clinical Indications This test may be useful in the evaluation of patients with intravasuclar hemolysis, unexplained hemolysis, thrombosis with unusual features, or bone marrow failure. Blood not collected in an EDTA tube or which has been improperly stored and handled prior to receipt cannot be processed. Blood stability limit for PNH testing is 24 hours after stated draw time. Clinical significance of results on specimens 24-48 hours old should be evaluated in the context of other clinical and laboratory findings. Blood older than 48 hours from draw time cannot be analyzed. Methodology High sensitivity flow cytometry for PNH is performed in accordance with Clinical Cytometry Society recommendations for high sensitivity flow cytometry testing.1 Cells are stained directly with FITC, PE, PE/Cy7, PerCP/ Cy5.5, APC and APC/Cy7-labeled monoclonal antibodies to detect antigens of interest. Antibodies used include CD15, CD24, CD33, CD45, CD59 and glycophorin A. Additionally, FLAER is employed. For erythrocytes, antibodies to glycophorin A are used to specifically gate red cells and PNH clones are identified by lack of CD59 expression. PNH erythrocyte clones are divided into those with partial loss of CD59 (PNH Type II Cells) or complete loss of CD59 (PNH Type III Cells). For granulocytes, CD15 and CD33 are used to specifically gate granulocytes. PNH-type granulocytes are then identified by lack of expression of CD24 and lack of reactivity to FLAER.

Recent studies have evaluated the role of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) in gastric cancer. This protein is a member of a family of receptors that have been shown to drive cell proliferation, adhesion, migration and differentiation.4 HER2 in breast cancer is known to be a marker of poor prognosis but is also predictive of response to the humanized monoclonal antibody trastuzumab (Herceptin®). Trastuzumab targets HER2 and induces antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity that inhibits HER2-mediated signaling, and prevents cleavage of the extracellular domain of HER2.5 Inclusion of this drug in combination with chemotherapy is now the standard of care in both early and metastatic breast carcinoma.6-8 There is growing support that HER2 is also a driver of tumorigenesis in gastric cancer, with between 7-34% of gastric carcinomas showing HER2 amplification or overexpression.4,9,10 Although the literature is somewhat varied, at least some studies have suggested that HER2 amplification/overexpression in gastric cancer is associated with poor outcomes and more aggressive disease.4,10 Recently, the results of the Trastuzumab for Gastric Cancer (ToGA) study were published wherein the clinical efficacy and safety of trastuzumab in addition to chemotherapy as the first-line treatment in patient’s with advanced gastric or gastroesophageal carcinoma were published. This study was a phase 3, randomized controlled trial that involved patients from 24 countries with either gastric or gastroesophageal junction cancers that were shown to overexpress HER2 by immunohistochemistry (IHC) or be HER2 amplified by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). To be eligible, carcinomas were 3+ by IHC or FISH positive with a HER2: CEP17 ratio ≥2. Participants were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either a chemotherapy regimen or chemotherapy in combination with intravenous trastuzumab; the primary endpoint was overall survival. The results showed a modest but statistically significant improvement in overall survival in those patients that received trastuzumab. The median overall survival was 13.8 months in those assigned to trastuzumab plus chemotherapy in comparison to 11.1 months in those who received chemotherapy alone (p=0.0046). Clinical indications HER2 testing is offered as a molecular adjunctive test in the management of patients with either metastatic gastric or gastroesophageal invasive carcinoma for whom therapy with the humanized monoclonal antibody trastuzumab is considered. Immunohistochemistry is the primary methodology for testing and can be performed on either biopsies or resection tissues that are formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded. If an equivocal result is obtained with IHC (see Interpretation section below), cases are reflexed for HER2 FISH testing, which is also performed on formalin-fixed and paraffinembedded tissue. IHC as the primary testing methodology is supported by subset analysis of patients within the ToGA trial that showed trastuzumab plus chemotherapy improved overall survival in patients with high expression of HER2 protein (IHC 2+ and FISH positive or immunohistochemistry 3+) compared with patients with low expression of HER2 protein (IHC 0 or 1+ and FISH positive). 9500 Euclid Avenue | Cleveland, Ohio 44195 | 216.444.5755 | 800.628.6816 | clevelandcliniclabs.com Interpretation Methodology IHC results are reported as: IHC is performed utilizing the 4B5 rabbit monoclonal antibody (Ventana Medical Systems, Intl; Tucson, AZ). The interphase FISH probe assay (PathVysion, Abbott Molecular, Vysis, Des Plaines, IL) is a dual DNA probe assay containing a HER2 probe that spans the entire HER2 gene and a CEP 17 probe that hybridizes to the alpha satellite DNA located at the centromere of chromosome 17 (17p11.1-q11.1). With the inclusion of the CEP 17 probe, the relative copy number of the HER2 gene can be determined and is expressed as the HER2/CEP17 ratio. • Negative for HER2 Expression (0 or 1+) • Equivocal for HER2 Expression (2+), and • Positive for HER2 Expression (3+). HER2 gene status is reported as either: • HER2 amplified or • HER2 non-amplified. The HER2 gene copy number is specified, and the HER2/ CEP17 ratio is reported (in gastric and gastroesophageal carcinoma a normal non-amplified ratio is < 2.0). Limitations IHC is reliably performed in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues that have been processed in 10% neutral buffered formalin. Inconsistent results may be seen in specimens that were improperly fixed (incorrect fixative, delay in fixation, or abbreviated fixation duration) and in small biopsies that suffer from architectural distortion. Similarly, the FISH assay performs well using formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue sections. Inconsistent FISH results are obtained in specimens processed in fixatives and preservatives that do not contain 10% neutral buffered formalin. References 1. Kamangar F, Dores GM, Anderson WF.

It has been estimated that approximately 3% of the world’s population is infected with HCV. This represents nearly 170 million people worldwide.1,4 In the United States, up to 3.9 million people (1.8% of the population) are currently living with HCV, of which as many as 2.7 million suffer from chronic infection.2,3 In the Western world, chronic damage from hepatitis C is the primary cause for end-stage liver disease requiring liver transplantation. Clinical Significance The 1989 discovery of the hepatitis C virus was a major development. Previously, it was clear that a major cause of acute hepatitis after a blood transfusion was related to neither hepatitis A nor to hepatitis B. This resulted in the early name for this disease: non-A, non-B hepatitis. It is now known that HCV is the cause for most of the non-A, non-B hepatitis cases. HCV is a single-stranded RNA virus that has approximately 9400 nucleotides that demonstrate significant genetic variation. HCV replicates in the liver, and is detectable in serum during acute and chronic infection. The RNA polymerase lacks the proofreading functions of DNA polymerase and introduces random nucleotide errors. This results in a relatively high rate of spontaneous nucleotide substitutions. As a consequence, HCV is a highly heterogeneous virus with at least six known major genotypes and more than 80 subtypes identified worldwide.5 Genotypes are classified based on differences in the amino acid sequence of specific proteins. Recent understanding of the natural history of chronic hepatitis C has greatly expanded, and more effective therapeutic strategies have been developed. Several studies have shown a strong correlation between HCV genotype and a patient’s response to various treatments. Determining genotypes is necessary because some hepatitis C viruses with certain genetic variations are harder to treat successfully and usually require a different treatment approach; others are much easier to treat and respond well to shorter treatment schedules. For many years, the standard of care for patients with chronic hepatitis C infection was peginterferon (PegIFN) alfa and ribavirin (RBV) taken for 24 to 48 weeks, depending on the genotype. However, less than 50% of patients responded to this therapy. In May 2011, the FDA approved the use of two new protease inhibitors – Incevik (telaprevir) and Victrelis (boceprevir) – for the treatment of hepatitis genotype 1, the most common form of hepatitis in North America. The drugs, used in conjunction with the standard interferon and ribavirin therapies, represent the first major therapeutic advance in the treatment of hepatitis C in more than a decade. The new protease inhibitors block the replication of an enzyme that is crucial for the hepatitis C virus to reproduce. In patients with hepatitis genotype 1, the use of the new protease inhibitor combined with the traditional antiviral treatment eliminated the virus in 70 to 80% of all cases. Patients with the other types of hepatitis C continue to be treated with peginterferon and ribavirin, which is successful in 80% or more in those with genotypes 2 and 3 infections.6-8 Clinical Indications Pre-treatment analysis of hepatitis C genotype is used to determine duration of therapy and predict therapeutic response. Interpretation The predominant HCV genotypes in the United States are 1a, 1b, 2a, 2b, and 3a; the other subtypes (4, 5, 6) are more prominent in other parts of the world.9 Limitations of the Assay This assay is based on the sequence variability of the 5’UTR, allowing differentiation between HCV genotypes 1 to 6. Subtyping may occasionally be limited. Methodology The gold standard for genotyping is determining the nucleotide sequence of an HCV isolate. Currently, this method is not practical for the clinical diagnostic laboratory, and a less labor-intensive technique such as line probe assay (LiPA) is employed. 07.14.06 (revised 03.22.12) Cleveland Clinic Laboratories 9500 Euclid Avenue, L15, Cleveland, Ohio 44195 800.628.6816 | clevelandcliniclabs.com The LiPA method uses genotypic-specific oligonucleotide probes immobilized onto membrane strips. The end products obtained from RT-PCR of the 5’UTR region of the clinical isolate are then hybridized onto the membrane containing the immobilized-oligonucleotides. A purple-brown line develops where sequence homology occurs between the biotinylated PCR products and the probe. Hybridization of 5’UTR amplification products with genotype specific probes is capable of discriminating among HCV subtypes 1a, 1b, 2a-2c, 3a-3c, 4a-4h, 5a, and 6a.10 References 1. Organization WH.

Several serological tests for HBV infection are available that measure antigens or antibodies produced at various stages of infection. These include HBsAg, Anti-HBs, total Anti-HBc, Anti-HBc IgM, HBeAg and Anti-HBe. Together with the clinical information, hepatic enzyme levels and viral molecular studies, these serological markers help in the diagnosis, prognosis and direction of treatment of HBV patients. The presence of Hepatitis B “e” antigen (HBeAg) in the serum/ plasma is considered to be a marker of HBV replication and infectivity, and is usually associated with the detection of HBV DNA. Transmission rates of HBV infection are much higher when the source is HBeAg positive. During acute infection, HBeAg appears shortly after the appearance of HBsAg. In patients who recover, HBeAg to anti-HBe seroconversion precedes HBsAg to anti-HBs seroconversion, and anti-HBe antibodies can persist after resolution of acute hepatitis B. In contrast, patients with chronic infection can have persistence of HBeAg for years to decades. During the HBeAg positive phase, most patients have detectable HBV DNA and active liver disease. Seroconversion from HBeAg to anti-HBe is usually associated with the disappearance of HBV DNA in serum and remission of liver disease. However, a small proportion of anti-HBe positive patients continue to have active liver disease and detectable HBV DNA in serum. This may be due to low levels of wild-type HBV or the presence of pre-core mutants. Indications The ADVIA Centaur® HBeAg Assay is an in vitro diagnostic immunoassay for the qualitative determination of the hepatitis B “e” antigen (HBeAg) in human serum and plasma from individuals who have signs and symptoms of hepatitis or who may be at risk for hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. This assay, in conjunction with other serological and clinical information, can be used for: • Determining infectivity of hepatitis B virus (HBV) carriers. • Monitoring infection status of chronically HBV-infected patients. • Monitoring serologic response of chronically HBV-infected patients who are receiving antiviral therapy. Methodology The ADVIA Centaur HBeAg Assay is an antibody-capture microparticle chemiluminometric immunoassay used to detect human hepatitis B e antigen in human serum and plasma. A sample of the patient’s serum is added to a small tube with the test reagents. Any HBeAg present in the sample will bind to labeled monoclonal antibodies directed against HBeAg to produce a light signal. The amount of relative light units (RLUs) detected by the system shows the amount of HBeAg present in the patient sample. Interpretation HBeAg results are reported as qualitative results of positive (reactive) or negative (nonreactive). As described above, measurable HepBe antigen is associated with the presence of replicating HBV in the circulation. Limitations of the Assay • The ADVIA Centaur HBeAg assay is limited to the detection of antigen to HBV in human serum or plasma (potassium EDTA plasma, lithium-heparinized or sodium-heparinized plasma). The performance of the ADVIA Centaur HBeAg assay has not been established with cord blood, neonatal specimens, tissue donors or body fluids other than serum or plasma, such as saliva, urine, amniotic or pleural fluids. • HBV mutants lacking the ability to produce HBeAg have been reported. In patients infected with these mutants, the HBeAg assay will be negative, but DNA-based testing for Hepatitis B will be positive. These mutant strains are more common in Asian and Mediterranean regions. • A reactive HBeAg result does not exclude the possibility of co-infection by another hepatitis virus. 10.16.12 Cleveland Clinic Laboratories 9500 Euclid Avenue, L15, Cleveland, Ohio 44195 800.628.6816 | clevelandcliniclabs.com References 1.

The standard method of performing the red cell phenotype is by serology, using reagent antisera specific for the antigens of interest. However, serological phenotyping is labor-intensive, the antisera are expensive and may be in short supply, and the method is not suitable for all patients (e.g., recently transfused patients). The HEA assay is a DNA-based test that overcomes some of the limitations of serological phenotyping. It predicts the probable red cell phenotype by detecting single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that define many blood group antigens. For many red cell antigens (notably excluding the ABO and D antigens), alleleic differences generally result from SNPs, and detecting these SNPs provides the basis for determining antigen expression. The HEA assay uses a DNA microarray to detect, in a single test, the polymorphisms associated with red cell antigens C/c, E/e, K/k, Jsa/Jsb, Kpa/Kpb, Fya/Fyb, Jka/Jkb, M/N, S/s, Lua/Lub, Doa/Dob, Hy+/Hy-, Jo(a+)/Jo(a-), LWa/LWb, Dia/Dib, Coa/Cob and Sc1/Sc2. The assay also detects the following mutations that cause weak or silent antigen expression: 265C>T and -67T>C in the FY gene, and +5G>T in intron 5 and 230 C>T in exon 5 of the GYPB gene. Clinical Indications The HEA assay is performed on DNA extracted from EDTA whole blood. The DNA region of interest is amplified by multiplex PCR, processed into single-stranded DNA and hybridized with allele-specific oligonucleotide probes to detect the relevant SNPs. The hybridization reaction is performed on a semiconductor chip mounted on a slide. Each chip contains beads expressing a library of allele-specific oligonucleotide probes matching either the wild-type or mutant allele. Hybridization of the test DNA with a matching probe results in probe elongation that is visualized by incorporation of a fluorescent label. An imaging system analyzes the intensities of the fluorescent signals for each SNP. Web-based software interprets the polymorphisms and provides a phenotype report with each antigen listed as ‘+’ (present) or ‘0’ (absent). For selected cases, review of the genotype report provides additional useful information, such as mutations that result in weak or silent expression of Fyb, and RHCE mutations that determine the V/VS phenotype. The HEA Assay is indicated for patient testing when a red cell phenotype is needed but serological phenotyping cannot be performed. Appropriate candidates for the HEA assay include: • Recently transfused patients or patients with a positive direct antiglobulin test. • Patients at high risk for red cell alloimmunization, including patients with sickle cell anemia, and other frequently transfused patients. • Patients with auto-antibodies that interfere with phenotyping and antibody identification. • Selected patients with Fyb-negative serological phenotype, for evidence of the Fyb silencing mutation (patients with this mutation generally do not require Fyb-negative red cell units for transfusion). • Patients who need to be typed for high-prevalence or low-prevalence antigens for which antisera are not readily available. Blood centers can use the HEA assay to type blood donors for rare red cell phenotypes. Limitations of the Assay • The HEA assay has been validated for patient use by the Cleveland Clinic Section of Transfusion Medicine, but it is not yet licensed by the FDA. • The assay does not detect all clinically significant antigens. 9500 Euclid Avenue | Cleveland, Ohio 44195 | 216.444.5755 | 800.628.6816 | clevelandcliniclabs.com Cleveland Clinic Laboratories • Assay results could be misleading, because the genotype may not always reflect the phenotype. Reasons for a genotype-phenotype discrepancy include rare polymorphisms (e.g., those found in ethnic minority populations) that are not represented in the assay, and undetected silent phenotype due to mutation that is not analyzed by the assay. Discrepancies between the molecular type and the expressed phenotype must be investigated. • Assay results should be interpreted cautiously for patients transfused with non-leukocyte-reduced blood, infants, hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients, and patients with severe leukopenia or leukocytosis.

Warfarin has a narrow therapeutic range, which can influence the optimal dose for individual patients, ranging from < 2 mg/day to > 10 mg/day. While underdosing can result in the formation of blood clots, overdosing can increase the risk for bleeding. The current approach to determining an appropriate warfarin dose for an individual considers age, gender, weight, height, current medications and diet and monitors the patient’s prothrombin time (PT) and international normalized ratio (INR). It is a lengthy process with an increased risk for ADE. Alternatively, molecular diagnostic tests based on the patient’s genetic information can be used to determine an appropriate dosing strategy to achieve a stable maintenance dose. Using this technique, recommended dosing and risk level can be determined quickly, providing safer, more effective warfarin therapy (www.warfarindosing.org). Clinical Indication Warfarin is a vitamin K antagonist composed of S- and R-isomers. The more potent S-warfarin is metabolized by an enzyme cytochrome P450 2C9 (CYP2C9), encoded by the CYP2C9 gene. Warfarin exerts its anticoagulant effect by inhibiting its target enzyme, Vitamin K epoxide reductase (VKOR), encoded by the Vitamin K epoxide reductase complex subunit 1 (VKORC1) gene. VKOR is required to recycle oxidized vitamin K to reduced vitamin K, a co-factor necessary for the production of activated clotting factors II, VII, IX and X.

Specifically, two variants in the CYP2C9 gene (CYP2C9*2 and CYP2C9*3) result in an enzyme with reduced activity, leading to increased active warfarin levels. A variant in the VKORC1 gene (VKORC1- 1639/3673 G>A) can lead to reduced gene expression, resulting in decreased level of VKOR. Together, these three variants can account for 40 to 60% of the variability in warfarin dosage. These allelic variations of individual patients can be factored in while determining the warfarin dose to reduce the risk of ADE. This genetic test is used to identify patients at risk for ADE due to impaired warfarin metabolism and sensitivity by: • Detecting two genetic variants in the warfarin metabolizing gene CYP2C9 (CYP2C9*2 and CYP2C9*3) • Detecting one genetic variant in the warfarin target gene VKORC1 (-1639G>A). Interpretation Interpretation of the assay is based on the presence of specific genetic variants of CYP2C9 and VKORC1: Genetic Variant CYP2C9 *1/*1 CYP2C9 *1/*2 CYP2C9 *1/*3 CYP2C9 *2/*2 CYP2C9 *2/*3 CYP2C9 *3/*3 VKORC1 -1639 GG VKORC1 -1639 AG VKORC1 -1639 AA Phenotype Extensive (normal) metabolizer Intermediate metabolizer Slow metabolizer Slow metabolizer Slow metabolizer Very slow (poor) metabolizer Low sensitivity to warfarin Medium sensitivity to warfarin High sensitivity to warfarin 1. Individuals with CYP2C9 variant alleles designated *2 and *3 have reduced enzyme activity compared to *1 (wild-type) individuals, leading to increased levels of the active S-warfarin, typically require reduced maintenance doses of warfarin and take longer to achieve steady state. 2. VKORC1 variants are alleles designated G/G, A/G, and G/G that alter the activity of VKOR enzymatic activity, leading to differences in warfarin dose required and time to achieve steady state. Individuals with the A/A genotype have decreased VKOR activity leading to increased inhibition to warfarin and are at increased risk of bleeding complications from anticoagulant overdose. They typically require reduced doses of warfarin to achieve therapeutic INR sooner compared with A/G individuals. 3. Prevalence of gene variations in CYP2C9 and VKORC1 differs with ethnicity. Ordering Recommendations • This test should be ordered prior to starting warfarin, or within the first week to help guide dosing. • This test is not recommended for patients on stable warfarin therapy. Limitations of the Assay Analysis for specific genetic variants detected in this test does not rule out the possibility of the presence of other variant alleles that may influence drug effect and metabolism. CYP2C9 variant alleles are important in the metabolism of drugs other than warfarin, such as phenytoin, glyburide, glimepiride, tolbutamide, sulfamethoxazole and certain nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents (NSAIDs). A *2 or *3 result for CYP2C9 is associated with a poor metabolizer phenotype for all drugs metabolized by CYP2C9. Methodology An array-based diagnostic test kit employing Infiniti analyzer (AutoGenomics Inc., CA) is used for genotyping CYP2C9VKORC1 variants. The assay involves a multiplex PCR amplification of genomic DNA followed by allele-specific (AS) primer extension using fluorescently labeled dCTP and hybridization onto a microarray coated with capturing oligonucleotides (zipcodes), which are specific for complementary oligonucleotides (anti-zipcodes) linked to the allele specific primer-extended products. A built-in confocal microscope is used to capture fluorescent signal from the pre-determined hybridization spots corresponding to specific products and genotypes deciphered from the signal ratio.

CYP2C19 is an isoenzyme that mediates the metabolic activation and elimination, and hence the therapeutic effect of a variety of drugs including antiplatelet agents, anticonvulsants, antidepressants, antineoplastic drugs, antiretroviral/antifungal drugs, antimalarial drugs, antithrombotics, antiulcer drugs, beta blockers and proton pump inhibitors. Drugs metabolized through CYP2C19 are listed in Table 1. The ability to metabolize drugs that are CYP2C19 substrates differs among patients resulting in wide variability in their response to specific drug therapy. A major cause of such interindividual variability is associated with variations in CYP2C19 gene encoding CYP2C19 enzyme. Prevalence of a specific genetic variant is dependent on racial and ethnic background. Over 25 variants have been identified for the CYP2C19 gene, and about a dozen variants, which are functionally impaired, can lead to the production of CYP2C19 with high, low or no enzyme activity causing abnormal levels of drugs and their derivatives. This can result in adverse events including toxicity, sub-therapeutic effect or non-responsiveness. On the basis of CYP2C19 metabolic ability, individuals can be broadly classified into four phenotypes: normal (extensive), intermediate, poor and ultra metabolizers. Since the therapeutic effect of a specific drug is dependant on whether it is metabolically activated or cleared/inactivated by CYP2C19, determining the phenotype of patients from their genotype may help to manage individualized therapy and limit adverse events. Clinical Significance of Genetic Testing The CYP2C19 isoenzyme metabolizes about 5-10% of all prescription drugs, and poor metabolizers taking those drugs may be predisposed to adverse events due to underdosing or overdosing, depending on whether it is a pro-drug or active drug, respectively. It is estimated that about 2-14% of the U.S. population are poor metabolizers. Pharmacokinetics of drugs and consequent therapeutic efficacy depend on the metabolic rate of activation or elimination. Poor metabolizers are likely to have markedly reduced or no conversion rate of pro-drugs (examples: clopidogrel; tamoxifen) to active drugs resulting in either sub-therapeutic effect or non-responsiveness (underdosing), which eventually require alternative treatment or increased dosage. Poor metabolizers may also have a reduced capacity to eliminate active drugs (examples: Prilosec, generic name – omeprazole; Valium, generic name – diazepam) leading to accumulation and resulting in toxicity and lifethreatening side effects (overdosing). Such adverse effects can be predicted by determining the genotype-phenotype associations (Figure 1). The homozygous wild type allele of CYP2C19, designated CYP2C19*1, is defined as an extensive metabolizer (EM). Nine common variants of CYP2C19 gene associated with impaired drug metabolism include *2 to *10. While the wild-type form of the CYP2C19 gene (*1) encodes an enzyme with normal functional activity, genetic variants (*2 to *8) encode enzymes with non-functional activity and two other variants (*9 and *10) have decreased functional activity. The most common poor metabolizer (PM) phenotypes are from CYP2C19 with homozygous *2 and *3 alleles. Homozygous *4 to *8 alleles are less common PM. One of the variants (*17) confers augmented enzyme activity, leading to an ultra metabolizer (UM) phenotype. Inheritance of one normal allele and one non-function allele can result in intermediate metabolizer (IM) phenotype. This genetic test is used to identify patients at risk for adverse events due to impaired metabolism by: Detecting 6 variants of CYP2C19 gene responsible for nonfunctional metabolic activity: • CYPC2C19*2, *3, *4, *6, *7, and *8 Detecting 2 variants of CYP2C19 gene responsible for decreased functional metabolic activity: • CYPC2C19*9 and *10 Detecting one variant of CYP2C19 gene responsible for increased functional metabolic activity: • CYPC2C19*17 Interpretation Interpretation of the assay is based on the presence of specific genetic variants of CYP2C19 (Table 2). 9500 Euclid Avenue | Cleveland, Ohio 44195 | 216.444.5755 | 800.628.6816 | clevelandcliniclabs.com 1. Individuals with CYP2C19 variant alleles designated *2, *3, *4, *6, *7 and *8 have non-functional activity compared to *1 (wild-type) individuals. Administration of pro-drug such as clopidogrel can result in a markedly reduced or no conversion to their active metabolite, and sub-therapeutic effect or non-responsiveness, which require alternative treatment or increased dosage. Conversely, administration of active drugs, such as diazepam and omeprazole, may result in impaired elimination, and potential risk of drug toxicity and life-threatening side effect, which requires alternative treatment or reduced dosage. 2. Individuals with CYP2C19 variant alleles designated *9 and *10 have decreased functional activity. Such individuals may have sub-therapeutic effect for pro-drugs. Conversely, administration of active drugs may result in impaired elimination, and potential risk of drug toxicity. 3. Individuals with CYP2C19 variant alleles designated *17 have augmented enzyme activity compared to *1 (wildtype) individuals, leading to increased conversion of pro-drugs to active metabolites with potential risk for toxicity requiring reduced dosage. Conversely, it may also lead to rapid elimination of active drugs and sub-therapeutic effect. 4. Individuals with a CYP2C19 genotype comprised of one of the non-function alleles (*2, *3, *4, *6, *7 or *8) and *17 have an unknown metabolizer phenotype. Due to the low population frequency of these alleles, the level of CYP2C19 activity cannot be predicted based on genotype. 5. Individuals with a CYP2C19 genotype comprised of one of the reduced function alleles (*9 or *10) and *17 have an unknown metabolizer phenotype. Due to the low population frequency of these alleles, the level of CYP2C19 activity cannot be predicted based on genotype. 6. Prevalence of CYP2C19 gene variants differs depending on ethnic background. The frequency of allele CYP2C19*2 has been reported as approximately 30-35% of Asians, and 15-26% of Caucasian and African Americans. The frequency of allele CYP2C19*3 has been reported as approximately 10% of Asians, and less than 2% of Caucasian and African Americans. 7. Genotype-phenotype interpretation should be made in the context of a patient’s clinical condition and concomitant medications, which may be substrates, inhibitors and inducers of CYP2C19. Methodology An array-based test kit employing Infiniti analyzer (AutoGenomics Inc., CA) is used for genotyping CYP2C19 variants.

A built-in confocal microscope is enabled to capture fluorescent signal from the pre-determined hybridization spots corresponding to specific products and genotypes deciphered from signal ratio. Limitations of the Assay Analysis for specific genetic variants detected in this test does not rule out the possibility of the presence of other variant alleles in CYP2C19 or other genes that may influence drug effect and metabolism. CYP2C19 variant alleles are important in the metabolism of drugs including but not limited to antithrombotics, anticonvulsants, antidepressants, antiulcer and antimalarial drugs, and proton pump inhibitors. A *2 or *3 result for CYP2C19 is associated with a poor metabolizer phenotype for all drugs metabolized by CYP2C19. Non-genetic factors such as concurrent medications, impaired hepatic function, obesity, insulin resistance and non-compliance can also affect CYP2C19 metabolism. These can lead to an increase or decrease in function relative to the predicted genotype. Co-administration of drugs metabolized by CYP2C19 may increase or decrease the CYP2C19 activity. CYP2C19 genotyping should not replace clinical monitoring of patients, when required. Table 1. Summary of drugs metabolized through cytochrome P450 2C19 1.

Clopidogrel is typically prescribed at a daily dosage of 75 mg with or without an initial loading dose of 300-600 mg, as needed. In combination with a daily dose of 75-325 mg aspirin, it is used at 75 mg dosage to prevent stent-thrombosis following PCI. Clopidogrel is converted into an active metabolite in the liver by several CYP enzymes including CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 (Figure 1). Of these, CYP2C19 plays a major role in the generation of active metabolite. There is a wide variability observed among patients in response to clopidogrel therapy that is attributed to at least three common variants in CYP2C19 gene. The wild-type form of the CYP2C19 gene (*1) encodes an enzyme with normal activity (extensive metabolizer) that current drug dosing recommendations are based on. Two variants (*2 and *3) encode enzymes with non-functional activity (poor metabolizer). In contrast, a third variant (*17) encodes an enzyme with increased activity (ultra metabolizer). Clopidogrel administered as a pro-drug is largely (~85%) hydrolyzed by esterases into inactive metabolites, and only approximately 15% is converted into an active form by hepatic Cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes, primarily by isoenzyme CYP2C19. The active metabolite binds irreversibly to the platelet adenosine diphosphate (ADP) receptor P2RY12 to inhibit platelet aggregation and consequent thrombosis (Figure 1). The antithrombotic effect of clopidogrel is not optimal in all patients, and up to 30% do not benefit from the therapy as determined from the measurement of residual platelet reactivity. Non-response or sub-optimal response to therapy can stem from pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, co-administration of other drugs and predisposition due to genetic, clinical and cellular factors. Among the CYPs, certain variations in the gene encoding CYP2C19 enzyme have been associated with poor metabolism of clopidogrel, and subsequent decreased formation of active metabolite. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has issued a black box warning about the reduced effectiveness of clopidogrel in patients who are poor metabolizers of the drug. The FDA has indicated the availability of tests to identify genetic differences in CYP2C19 function, and advised healthcare professionals to consider alternate therapy or dosing strategies for poor metabolizers. As a result, CYP2C19*2 and CYP2C19*3 variants confer non-functional or markedly reduced metabolic status and have been associated with non-responsiveness to clopidogrel reflected in reduced platelet inhibition and poor outcomes including increased risk for stent thrombosis, MI, stroke and death. On the other hand, CYP2C19*17 is associated with an increased response to clopidogrel and risk for bleeding. Accordingly, while sub-optimal response to clopidogrel can lead to thrombosis, super-optimal response can result in bleeding. Thus, the genetic testing of patients to determine CYP2C19 gene variants can enable individualized antithrombotic therapy. However, this genotyping assay should be used in conjunction with the aspirin/clopidogrel aggregation assay to determine platelet response to clopidogrel. This genetic test is used to identify patients at risk for adverse events due to impaired clopidogrel metabolism by: Detecting two variants of CYP2C19 gene responsible for non-functional activity. • CYP2C19*2 and CYP2C19*3 Detecting one variant of CYP2C19 gene responsible for increased functional activity. • CYP2C19*17 9500 Euclid Avenue | Cleveland, Ohio 44195 | 216.444.5755 | 800.628.6816 | clevelandcliniclabs.com Interpretation Interpretation of the assay is based on the presence of specific genetic variants of CYP2C19. The genotypes including alleles and phenotypes of CYP2C19 are shown in Table 1. 2. Individuals with CYP2C19 variant alleles designated *17 have increased enzyme activity compared to *1 (wildtype) individuals, leading to increased levels of active metabolite and may require lower maintenance doses of clopidogrel. 3. Individuals with a CYP2C19 genotype comprised of either *2 or *3 and *17, and allele with combination of *4,*6*10 or *17 have an unknown metabolizer phenotype. Due to the low population frequency of these alleles, the level of CYP2C19 activity cannot be predicted based on genotype. 1. Individuals with CYP2C19 variant alleles designated *2 and *3 have non-functional enzyme activity compared to *1 (wild-type) individuals, leading to absent or markedly decreased metabolite that may require increased maintenance doses of clopidogrel.

Many sarcomas show characteristic combinations of morphologic and immunophenotypic features, which, in concert with clinical information and tumor site, allow their appropriate classification. However, their histologic features frequently overlap or may not be apparent due to poor differentiation or limited sampling in small biopsies. In recent years, molecular genetic findings have advanced the basic scientific and clinical understanding of sarcomas and have become increasingly important in their precise diagnostic classification. Detection of chromosomal translocations in neoplastic cells is one of the molecular characteristics that can serve as a highly precise tool in diagnosis. These chromosomal translocations result in specific gene fusions, and each gene fusion or its closely related variant is usually present in most cases of a given sarcoma subtype. Such highly specific genetic changes are known to exist in more than 10 different sarcoma subtypes, and their expanding utilization in diagnosis is similar to what has become the standard of care in the diagnosis of leukemias and lymphomas in the past decade. Detection of translocation events in sarcomas provides an important objective tool for confirmation of sarcoma diagnosis and disease monitoring, and their demonstration is important when considering tumor-specific therapeutic approaches to clinical management. Clinical Indications In situ hybridization (FISH) testing is performed for chromosomal abnormalities in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded specimens of soft tissue neoplasms. A series of break-apart format FISH assays is currently available and includes testing for the following: 1. translocations involving the EWSR1 gene at 22q12 (Ewing sarcoma, desmoplastic small round-cell tumor, clear-cell sarcoma, angiomatoid fibrous histiocytoma, soft tissue myoepithelioma and extraskeletal myxoid chondrosacoma). 2. the DDIT3 (CHOP) gene at 12q13 (myxoid/round cell liposarcoma). 3. the FOX01A (FKHR) gene at 13q14 (alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma). 4. the SYT gene at 18q11.2 (synovial sarcoma). 5. the FUS gene at 16p11.2 (low-grade fibromyxoid sarcoma, sclerosing epithelioid fibrosarcoma, angiomatoid fibrous histiocytoma, myxoid liposarcoma). 6. the ALK gene at 2p23 (inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor). Interpretation Detection via FISH of amplification of the MDM2 gene locus is also helpful in the differential diagnosis of soft tissue tumors of lipomatous derivation (see separate Technical Brief). Optimal samples have a minimum of 40 tumor cells for analysis. Positive test: 10% or > cells showing a break-apart configuration of the two probes included in each of the individual assays. Negative test: < 10% break-apart signals identified. Methodology FISH can be utilized as an ancillary test in conjunction with routine histologic assessment and immunohistochemical studies in the diagnosis of soft tissue neoplasms. All FISH assays included in this panel utilize break-apart format probes and can be performed on routine sections from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue. Fixation in solutions other than neutral buffered formalin compromises the quality of the assay and are not recommended. Following cell conditioning, the slides are protease-digested, post-fixed in formaldehyde, washed and dehydrated. Hybridization is performed using a selected pair of dual-color break-apart interphase FISH probes (Abbott Molecular, Vysis, Des Plaines, IL). Each probe kit includes two directly labeled probes flanking each of the following genes: EWSR1 (22q12), SYT (18q11), DDIT3 (CHOP) (12p13), FUS (16p11.2), ALK (2p23) and FOX01A (FKHR) (13q14). The reagents have been validated as Analyte-Specific Reagents. The cells are analyzed using fluorescence microscopy. 9500 Euclid Avenue | Cleveland, Ohio 44195 | 216.444.5755 | 800.628.6816 | clevelandcliniclabs.com Cleveland Clinic Laboratories Limitations of the Assay SYT gene translocation detected in a case of synovial sarcoma by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), using a break-apart probe. The break-apart configuration (separation) of red and green signals in the tumor nuclei indicates a translocation involving the region of the SYT gene. False negative results may occur if less than 40 tumor cells are available for analysis. The assay has been developed for formalin-fixed tissue, and fixation in other solutions may compromise the assay results. Recommended Reading 5. Clark J, Rockques PJ, Crew AJ et al.

Ninety percent of bladder cancer cases are transitional cell carcinomas (TCC). At presentation, about 75% of tumors are superficial, of which 50 to 80% will have one or multiple recurrences, and 15 to 25% will progress to muscle-invasive tumors. Follow-up cystoscopy and urine cytology have been used to detect recurrence and tumor progression in patients with superficial TCC. However, low-grade tumors tend to have false negative cytology results. Several genetic alterations have been identified to occur at high frequency in bladder cancer. These include the loss of a portion of chromosome 9 (presumably carrying a tumor suppressor gene), as well as numerical change in chromosomes 3, 7 and 17.1 Using a multicolor set of fluorescent DNA probes (UroVysion, Abbott Molecular, Vysis, Des Plaines, IL), several studies have demonstrated that detection of chromosomal abnormalities by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) has higher sensitivity in detection of TCC recurrence than does cytology, while maintaining high specificity.2-4 This technique has been validated for use as an adjunct to urinary cytology utilizing thin layer liquid-based preparations.5 are identified and marked on the slides. Using a pretreatment kit, the slides are protease digested, fixed in formaldehyde, washed and dehydrated. Hybridization is performed using a four-color multitarget interphase FISH probe kit. The kit includes directly labeled probes to the peri-centromeric regions of chromosomes 3 (CEP3-red), 7 (CEP7-green) and 17 (CEP17-aqua), and to the locus 9p21 (LSI 9p21-gold). The cells are analyzed using fluorescence microscopy. Interpretation Optimal samples have a minimum of 25 transitional cells for analysis. Positive test: Four or more cells showing gain of 2 or more chromosomes (3, 7 and 17) in the same cell, OR loss of 9p21 locus in 12 or more cells, OR isolated gain of one of the chromosomes 3, 7, or 17 in >10% of the analyzed cells.The loss of 9p21 must be homozygous to be classified as positive. Negative test: Relevant chromosomal changes are not found after screening of the entire slide. The cellularity is limited for cases having fewer than 25 urothelial cells to count. Clinical Indications Cleveland Clinic Laboratories now offers analysis of chromosomal abnormalities in urine cytology specimens using multicolor, multitarget UroVysion FISH probes (chromosomes 3, 7, 17 and 9p21 locus). FISH can be utilized as an ancillary test increasing the sensitivity of urinary cytology in the detection of TCC. Methodology FISH can be performed on previously prepared thin layer, liquid-based cytology slides (ThinPrep, Cytyc, Boxborough, MA) or, alternatively, on fresh voided/instrumented urine specimens shipped in 70% ethanol. ThinPrep slides from voided or instrumented urine are prepared and stained with Papanicolaou stain.6 The transitional cells Multicolor fluorescence in situ hybridization performed on a slide prepared from a voided urine specimen from a patient with bladder cancer. The cells display gain of extra copies of chromosome 3 (red), 7 (green), and 17 (aqua).

Metaphase cytogenetic studies are frequently unsuccessful in plasma cell myeloma because the malignant cells grow poorly in culture. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) studies are capable of detecting these abnormalities in nondividing (interphase) cells, but FISH studies must be performed selectively on plasma cells because the tumor cells frequently represent only a minority of cells present in the samples submitted for analysis.2,3 In our laboratory, plasma cells are specifically targeted for FISH analysis using sequential Giemsa staining and FISH staining with image analysis to identify and locate plasma cells and analyze FISH signals only in the plasma cell compartment. Clinical Indications Cleveland Clinic Laboratories offers FISH studies to detect deletions of chromosome 13q, deletions of 17p (TP53), and the IGH translocations t(11;14)(q13;q32) IGH/CCND1, t(4;14)(p13;q32) MMSET/IGH, and t(14;16)(q32;q32) IGH/ MAF in bone marrow aspirates.

Several types of non-Hodgkin lymphoma are associated with specific, recurring cytogenetic abnormalities that are of diagnostic significance.1-3 Cleveland Clinic Laboratories offers FISH analysis for the following cytogenetic abnormalities: Interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) studies offer the ability to detect cytogenetic abnormalities in nondividing cells. FISH studies are especially valuable in lymph node or other solid tissue biopsies because they can be performed on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues and can, therefore, provide cytogenetic information even when material is not available for traditional banded karyotyping studies. 1. t(14;18)(q32;q21) (IGH/BCL2): The IGH/BCL2 translocation is present in approximately 70-95% of cases of follicular lymphoma and 30% of diffuse large B-cell lymphomas (1,2). Analysis for t(14;18)(q32;q21) or variant BCL2 translocations is useful in distinguishing these lymphomas from other types of NHL. 2. t(11;14)(q13;q32) (CCND1/IGH): This translocation or another rare variant CCND1 translocation is present in the large majority of cases of mantle cell lymphoma. 3. t(8;14)(q24;q32) (MYC/IGH) and variants: By definition, all cases of Burkitt lymphoma contain a MYC rearrangement, usually t(8;14).

Peripheral blood or bone marrow aspirate specimens are also suitable for most probes. Hybridizations are performed using the appropriate two-color probe set (Abbott Molecular, Des Plains, IL), and cells are examined using fluorescence microscopy. The FISH reagents employed are either dual-fusion (DF) probes (e.g. t(14;18), t(11;14)) that specifically identify a particular translocation, or are break-apart (BA) probes (e.g. CMYC) that identify the presence of a translocation involving one gene but do not identify the partner gene specifically.

Within the category of myeloproliferative neoplasms, four entities are defined by specific recurrent cytogenetic abnormalities that may be identified by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH): 1. Chronic myeloid leukemia, BCR/ABL1 positive: By definition, all cases of chronic myeloid leukemia contain a BCR/ABL1 translocation. This abnormality is also found in a subset of cases of acute lymphoblastic leukemia. 2. Myeloid neoplasms with abnormalities of PDGFRA: These cases exhibit leukocytosis with prominent eosinophilia and a rearrangement of chromosome 4q12 that produces a FIP1L1-PDGFRA fusion gene. This rearrangement is cryptic by banded cytogenetics alone, emphasizing the importance of FISH analysis for diagnosis. 3. Myeloid neoplasms with abnormalities of PDGFRB: Myeloid neoplasms with PDGFRB translocations show distinctive features including eosinophilia and, in some cases, monocytosis. The most common abnormality is a t(5;12)(q33;p13) ETV6/PDGFRB, but more than 20 different translocation partner genes have been described. FISH is performed using a break-apart probe designed to detect PDGFRB translocations. Although these abnormalities are most often detectable by banded cytogenetics, the 2008 WHO recommends confirmation by a molecular method such as FISH, which improves both specificity and sensitivity of detection. 4. Myeloid neoplasms with abnormalities of FGFR1: Myeloid neoplasms with FGFR1 abnormalities are heterogeneous, but are usually associated with peripheral eosinophilia. Some cases represent so-called “stem-cell leukemia/ lymphoma” with clonally related myeloid and lymphoblastic tumors. The most common abnormality is t(8;13) (p12;q12) FGFR1/ZNF198, but numerous alternative FGFR1 translocations have also been described. FGFR1 translocations are detected using a break-apart probe strategy designed to detect any FGFR1 translocation. Clinical Indications FISH studies are useful in the workup of suspected myeloproliferative neoplasms, especially those showing eosinophilia. Although isolated eosinophilia is an uncommon presentation of BCR/ABL1 positive CML, sufficient morphologic overlap is possible between CML and the myeloid neoplasms presenting with eosinophilia to warrant exclusion of BCR/ABL1 in these cases. FISH testing may be ordered for each probe set individually, or as the FISH for MPN panel that includes all four of these loci. Interpretation Patient samples are probed and 200 nuclei are scored. Results for each probe set are compared to reference ranges established for abnormal signal patterns in healthy controls. Results are reported as positive or negative for each abnormality. The percentage of abnormal nuclei identified and interpretation are provided. Limitations of the Assays False negative results may occur if the clonal cells are present below the limit of detection of FISH assays. These tests are not intended for minimal residual disease detection. Rarely, fusion genes may arise through insertion events that are cryptic by FISH. Methodology FISH can be performed on peripheral blood or bone marrow aspirate specimens. For PDGFRB and FGFR1 probes, paraffin-embedded material is also acceptable.

Reference ranges are established based on analysis of normal control peripheral blood and bone marrow samples. Patient samples are classified as positive for a given abnormality when the percentage of nuclei with an abnormal signal pattern exceeds the reference range. Recurring cytogenetic abnormalities in MDS include monosomy of chromosome 5, deletions on chromosome 5q, monosomy 7, deletions on chromosome 7q, deletions on chromosome 20q, and trisomy 8. The identification of any of these abnormalities in bone marrow or peripheral blood using metaphase cytogenetic analysis or FISH studies assists in the diagnosis and prognostic assessment of myelodysplastic syndromes. These abnormalities, however, are not specific for myelodysplastic syndromes, as they may also occur in acute myeloid leukemia or in other malignancies. FISH data must therefore always be interpreted in the context of all of the clinical and pathologic findings in a given case. Interphase fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) studies increase the rate of detection of myelodysplasia-associated abnormalities compared to metaphase cytogenetics alone, especially in cases with suboptimal metaphase cytogenetic studies.2 Clinical Indications Cleveland Clinic Laboratories offer FISH studies to detect -5/5q-, -7/7q-, 20q- and/or +8. Peripheral blood or bone marrow specimens or cytogenetic cell pellets are suitable for analysis. Limitations of the Assay False negative results may occur when the neoplastic cells represent a small population of cells (less than the cutoff percentages listed above). A normal result with this assay does not exclude the presence of other karyotypic abnormalities that are not targeted by these probes. The evaluation of suspected myelodysplasia should therefore also always include standard metaphase cytogenetic analysis. Methodology FISH analysis is performed on gravity preparations of peripheral blood, bone marrow, or cytogenetic cell pellets. Cells are hybridized with a series of six probes described below. Probes are combined into three probe mixtures, each performed on a separate slide. Two hundred cells are evaluated for each probe using supervised, automated signal enumeration. Probe set 1: A two-color probe set is used to detect abnormalities of chromosome 5. One 190 kb probe, labeled in red (PlatinumBright 550), hybridizes to the HTERT locus on chromosome 5p15. A second, 645 kb probe, labeled in green (PlatinumBright 495), hybridizes to the EGR1 locus on chromosome 5q31. 9500 Euclid Avenue | Cleveland, Ohio 44195 | 216.444.5755 | 800.628.6816 | clevelandcliniclabs.com Cleveland Clinic Laboratories Probe set 2: A two-color probe set is used to detect abnormalities of chromosome 7. The CEP7 probe, labeled in green (Spectrum Green) hybridizes to the chromosome 7 centromere. A second, 200kb probe, labeled in red (Spectrum Orange), hybridizes to the LSI D7S486 locus at chromosome 7q31. Probe set 3: A two-color probe set is used to detect abnormalities of chromosome 8 and/or chromosome 20. The CEP8 probe, labeled in green (Spectrum Green) hybridizes to the chromosome 8 centromere.

These neoplasms can be classified as lipoma or atypical lipomatous tumor {(ALT)/well-differentiated liposarcoma (WDLPS)}. Classification of this group of tumors can be challenging, since many ALT/WDLPS do not have cytologic atypia or lipoblasts and therefore mimic benign lipomas when histopathologic analysis alone is used. 1. The target tissue is the patient’s tumor, obtained from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue samples. Clinical Significance The distinction between a lipoma and ALT/WDLPS is very important, as lipomas do not exhibit locally aggressive behavior and do not require clinical follow up. Conversely, ALT/WDLPS do exhibit locally aggressive behavior and require long-term follow up. Lipoma and ALT/WDLPS both are treated surgically, but the extent of surgery that is indicated differs radically between the two types of tumors. Interpretation Methodology used for the assay is florescence in situ hybridization (FISH) using a DNA probe with specificity for the chromosomal locus that includes the MDM2 gene and a control centomeric probe to chromosome 12 (CEP12). Signals for MDM2 and CEP12 are enumerated for individual tumor cell nuclei, and the MDM2/CEP12 ratio is calculated. Limitations of the Assay It is very important that the tissue used for the FISH assay be fixed in formalin. Alternative fixative solutions frequently and unpredictably compromise hybridization between the probe and the target MDM2 gene and centomeric control loci. Also, necrosis within the neoplasm or very extended fixation will interfere with successful hybridization and compromise assay performance. 2. The tumor should be viable, and blocks should be selected in which the tumor tissue is relatively dense and as free as possible of adjacent normal tissue, necrosis, blood or dense inflammation. 3. As long as tumor tissue is present in the biopsy specimen, the specimen can be analyzed, including needle biopsy specimens. 4. Fixation should be 10% neutral buffered formalin, or other formalin-based fixative solution. Alternative fixatives often compromise hybridization between probe and target, and blocks prepared from tissue fixed in non-formalin-based solutions should not be submitted for evaluation. 5. Result provided is a ratio between the MDM2 signals and the centromeric chromosome 12 control signals. An MDM2/CEP12 ratio exceeding 2.0 is indicative of gene amplification. References 1.

Breast tumors differ in their biological behavior. One important challenge is the identification of tumors of low clinical and/or pathologic stage that display phenotypic or genotypic characteristics that indicate potential for aggressive malignant behavior (metastasis, recurrence, and early death). Proteins expressed on tumor cells have become recognized as markers of biological behavior. Amplification and overexpression of the oncogene HER2 occurs in 12-20% of human invasive breast carcinomas.2,3 HER2 amplification in patients with invasive breast carcinoma is associated with a significant reduction in metastasis-free survival, and similarly staged patients without HER2 gene amplification have a high likelihood of remaining cancer-free years after removal of the primary tumor.2-5 HER2-positive patients are more likely to respond to regimens containing adriamycin and less likely to respond to tamoxifen.6,7 Furthermore, patients with primary and metastatic breast carcinoma whose tumors have amplification of the HER2 gene and the protein it encodes may benefit from therapy with the humanized monoclonal antibody trastuzumab (Herceptin®) in combination with chemotherapy.8-10 Cleveland Clinic Laboratories offers HER2 gene amplification analysis of breast carcinoma by interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) assay of paraffin-embedded tumor sections. Performance and interpretation of the assay are done in accordance with ASCO/CAP guidelines for HER2 testing (reference below). If aneusomy of chromosome 17 is identified by the PathVysion assay, additional FISH testing using a laboratory-developed assay with a D17S122 reference probe is performed. This is done to either confirm the presence of aneusomy or correct the ratio for gains at the centromeric reference probe locus. D17S122 reflex testing is also done for monosomy of chromosome 17. Clinical Indications HER2 gene amplification analysis is offered specifically as a prognostic and predictive molecular marker for invasive breast carcinoma and as an adjunctive test in the management of patients with advanced breast carcinoma for whom therapy with trastuzumab is contemplated. FISH also may be useful as a confirmatory reflex assay for breast carcinoma cases for which an equivocal score has been identified previously by immunohistochemistry. Interpretation HER2 gene amplification is reported as either amplified, not amplified, or equivocal. The HER2 gene copy number is specified, and the HER2/chromosome 17 ratio is reported. Amplified cases demonstrate a ratio of 2.3 or greater and non-amplified cases demonstrate a ratio equal to or less than 1.7. Equivocal cases demonstrate a ratio equal to or greater than 1.8 but equal to or less than 2.2, and require reflex testing by immunohistochemistry per ASCO/CAP guidelines (reference below). Aneusomy and monosomy of chromosome 17, gains at the CEP17 centromeric locus, genomic heterogeneity, and allelic loss (usually monoallelic deletion) of HER2 are also reported if identified. Limitations of the Assay The FISH assay performs well using paraffin sections of formalin-fixed tissue fixed and processed in accordance with ASCO/CAP guidelines. Time and duration of formalin fixation are required for testing to be performed. Methodology The assay consists of a modified interphase FISH probe assay (PathVysion, Abbott Molecular, Vysis, Des Plaines, Ill.) that quantifies HER2 gene amplification in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded human breast carcinoma tissue. 9500 Euclid Avenue | Cleveland, Ohio 44195 | 216.444.5755 | 800.628.6816 | clevelandcliniclabs.com Cleveland Clinic Laboratories References 1. www.cancer.org/docroot/STT/stt_0.asp 7.

In 2013, it is estimated that 76,690 new cases of melanoma will be diagnosed with 9,480 deaths.1 Although the majority of melanomas can be distinguished from benign nevi on the basis of histologic criteria, a significant subset of melanocytic proliferations present conflicting features that preclude a definitive diagnosis for even the most expert pathologists. An unacceptably high number of lesions cannot be precisely and reproducibly classified as either entirely benign or malignant by routine histologic and immunohistochemical techniques. The morphologic limitations in the diagnosis of these histologically borderline lesions lead to both under- and over-diagnosis of melanoma. Over-diagnosis of melanoma can lead to inappropriate therapy and psychologic burdens, whereas under-diagnosis can lead to inadequate treatment of a potentially deadly cancer. The fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) molecular assay helps to distinguish these borderline cases by looking for DNA abnormalities present in the vast majority (95%) of melanomas but typically absent in benign nevi. The identification of common chromosomal aberrations in melanomas that are typically absent in benign nevi has led to the use of FISH probes on chromosomes 6 and 11 that can aid in the diagnosis of melanoma in histologically ambiguous cases. The following 4 FISH probes targeting three loci – RREB1 (6p25), MYB (6q23) and CCND1 11q13, and one centomere on two chromosomes accurately distinguished melanoma from benign nevi with a high sensitivity and specificity. The melanoma FISH test can be an important tool in the diagnosis of melanoma in cases with ambiguous or borderline histological findings, and thereby significantly impact the management of patients by guiding the most appropriate treatment. Clinical Indications Although the clinical and pathologic diagnosis of some melanomas is clear-cut, the diagnosis of certain melanocytic proliferations remains one of the most challenging areas in pathology. The differential diagnosis could be an entirely benign lesion such as a Spitz nevus versus a melanoma with spitzoid morphologic features by conventional histopathological evaluation. The melanoma FISH test is an important tool in the diagnosis of melanoma in cases with ambiguous or borderline microscopic findings. It has increased sensitivity and specificity compared to other ancillary techniques such as immunohistochemistry. This assay is not to be used as a screening test for obvious melanoma and should always be ordered as a part of a dermatologic pathology consult and interpreted in a working context. Methodology The test can be performed on routinely processed formalinfixed paraffin-embedded tissue, and utilizes DNA probe hybridization, fluorescence microscopy and signal enumeration. The test is similar to other diagnostic FISH assays. Short DNA fragments (FISH probes) are hybridized to a 5 µm–thick, formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded section of a tumor of interest. Overlapping wavelength spectrums of the currently available fluorochromes limit the maximum to four probes that can be concurrently hybridized on a single slide. Nonbound, fluorescently labeled DNA is washed away. The section on a slide is then examined under a fluorescence microscope and demonstrates specific signals enumeration. Interpretation A distinct fluorescent signal indicates a single copy of the gene or centromere. Ideally, each diploid nucleus will display two signals for each analytical chromosomal locus probed, subject to truncation artifact. Identification of three or more signals for a DNA region of interest is consistent with a gain at that locus. If a DNA region of interest is deleted, less than 2 (1 or 0) signals will be identified. In a typical 4 to 6 µm formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) section, nuclear truncation occurs. Therefore, for many perfectly normal diploid cells, hybridized probes will be outside the plane of section or overlapping, resulting in less than 2 signals per nucleus. False-positive or false-negative signals can result from imperfect hybridization. Flourescence microscopy can then be used to ascertain the number of signals per probed locus in each cell nucleus detected by specific fluoresence. Because of the inherent variability of FISH signals, each experiment requires the examination of an adequate number of cells and the implementation of strict quality control measures. The collected data are presented as a percentage of nuclei containing more than 2 copies of a particular locus 9500 Euclid Avenue | Cleveland, Ohio 44195 | 216.444.5755 | 800.628.6816 | clevelandcliniclabs.com Cleveland Clinic Laboratories or as a percentage of cells showing an increase or loss of signals in comparison to a probe directed against a centromere region of a chromosome. With appropriate controls, the signal cutoffs (a percentage of cells that must fulfill a particular FISH criterion for a result to be considered abnormal) have been determined and validated for each probe. Rigorously interrogated cutoff values are critical to the robustness of a FISH assay. a diagnostic adjunct to routine pathologic examination of tissue and clinicopathologic correlation. At Cleveland Clinic Laboratories, our analyses are performed by an experienced molecular technologist working closely with the molecular pathologist to ensure signal enumeration is performed for the appropriate melanocytic target cells. Final interpretation is performed by a board-certified dermatopathologist. 2. Song, J, Mooi, WJ, Petronic-Rosic, V, Shea, CR, Stricker, T, Krausz, T. Nevus versus melanoma: to FISH or not to FISH.

Graft loss will occur if the process is not managed appropriately. Recognition of BK viral nephropathy is essential to the successful management of immunosuppression in patients undergoing renal transplantation, since the appropriate treatment for BK viral nephropathy is usually a reduction in immunosuppression. Conversely, if the underlying cause of increasing renal insufficiency is acute allograft rejection, the appropriate response is usually increased immunosuppression. While viral inclusions can be recognized in many, if not most, cases by conventional histopathologic examination, in situ hybridization is a valuable ancillary tool to confirm the presence or absence of BK viral nephropathy in a renal transplant biopsy. Results are reported qualitatively as positive or negative for the BK virus by FISH. The BK virus is one of three polyoma viruses (BK, JC and Merkel) in the family Polyomaviridae. The human BK virus is a relatively small, common, non-enveloped, double-stranded DNA virus. The lytic destruction of infected tubular renal epithelium induces an influx of activated T lymphocytes not dissimilar to the interstitial infiltrate of T cells associated with acute allograft rejection. The Cleveland Clinic Department of Molecular Pathology has developed a fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) assay for detection of BK viral DNA sequences in infected tissue. Clinical Indications The assay is performed using tissue biopsy specimens with suspected BK virus infection. Although the assay is most commonly utilized for the diagnosis of BK viral nephropathy in renal allograft biopsies, other tissue specimens such as urinary bladder biopsies may also be evaluated. Limitations of the Assay The tissue submitted for analysis must not be necrotic. An on-slide internal positive hybridization control for chromosome 8 centromeric sequences must be positive. Methodology The assay format utilizes an external positive control (renal allograft tissue with previously established BK viral nephropathy) that is probed 1) using BK-specific sequences, and 2) using the pBR322 negative control probe (plasmid DNA without the specific BK complementary DNA sequences). The tissue biopsy specimen is probed with BK-specific DNA that has been labeled with SpectrumRed and also contains a SpectrumGreen-labeled CEP8 centromeric probe as an internal control for successful hybridization. A separate negative control slide is probed with the pBR322 plasmid control that does not have BK complementary sequences; this negative control probe has been labeled with SpectrumRed and also contains CEP8-SpectrumGreen as a control for successful hybridization.

Most patients with B-CLL are older than 50 years of age at diagnosis, and most cases will follow an indolent clinical course. False negative results may occur if the neoplastic cells represent <15% (for 17p deletions) or <10% (for all other abnormalities) of the total cellularity in the sample analyzed. In recent years, researchers have described chromosomal abnormalities in B-CLL that are correlated with prognosis and resistance to fludarabine.1-3 Deletions of chromosome 17p involving the TP53 locus have been identified in approximately 10% of B-CLL cases and are associated with an adverse prognosis. Similarly, deletions of chromosome 11q involving the ATM gene are reported in approximately 20% of B-CLL cases and likewise are associated with poor outcomes. In contrast, cases of B-CLL with deletions of chromosome 13q as a sole abnormality, detected in approximately 40% of cases, are associated with a favorable prognosis. Trisomy of chromosome 12 has been identified in approximately 10% of B-CLL and is associated with atypical morphologic features and an intermediate prognosis. Interphase fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) is superior to metaphase cytogenetic studies for detecting these chromosomal abnormalities due to the low proliferative rate of B-CLL cells in culture.2,4 Clinical Indications Cleveland Clinic Laboratories offers FISH analysis for abnormalities of chromosomes 17p, 11q, 13q, and trisomy 12 to assist in the clinical evaluation of patients with B-CLL. Peripheral blood and bone marrow specimens involved by B-CLL are suitable for analysis. Interpretation Cases are classified as positive for del(11q), del(13q), or trisomy 12 when the corresponding abnormal signal pattern is observed in >10% of nuclei. Cases are classified as positive for 17p deletion when loss of the 17p signal is detected in >15% of nuclei. This assay should be employed only in cases with an established diagnosis of B-CLL. The abnormalities identified by the test are not specific to B-CLL. FISH studies do not exclude the presence of other chromosomal abnormalities that also may influence the prognosis of B-CLL. Methodology FISH analysis is performed on gravity preparations of peripheral blood or bone marrow samples. Cells are hybridized with a set of five probes described below (Vysis, Inc., Downer’s Grove, Ill.). Probes are combined into two probe mixtures, each performed on a separate slide. 100 cells are evaluated for each probe. Probe Set 1: • Del(17p): The LSI p53 (17p13.1) probe is a ~145 kb sequence labeled in Spectrum Orange. • Del(11q23): The LSI ATM probe is a ~500 kb probe that encompasses the entire ATM locus at 11q22.3 and is labeled in Spectrum Green. Probe Set 2: • Del(13q): Abnormalities of chromosome 13q are detected using two probes to this region: The LSI D13S319 probe is a ~130 kb sequence that hybridizes to chromosome 13q14.3 and is labeled in Spectrum Orange. The LSI 13q34 probe is a ~550 kb probe to the 13q34 region and is labeled in Spectrum Aqua. • CEP12: The CEP12 probe hybridizes to the centromeric region of chromosome 12 and is labeled in Spectrum Green. 9500 Euclid Avenue | Cleveland, Ohio 44195 | 216.444.5755 | 800.628.6816 | clevelandcliniclabs.com Cleveland Clinic Laboratories References 1.

The FDA-approved assay is performed on a formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) NSCLC tissue specimen. An alternative approach is to perform the ALK FISH procedure on ThinPrep cytology slides (Cytyc, Boxborough, Massachussetts) rather than FFPE tissue sections targeting cytologically abnormal cells. Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death in men and women worldwide. Approximately 85% of all lung cancers are of non-small cell type. Advances in surgical treatment and combination therapies have marginally improved the average one-year survival rate (38% for stage IA-IIB, Source: National Cancer Institute Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results [SEER] database) from the period 1975-1979 to the present; but the five-year survival rate for all stages of lung cancer combined remains at 15%. The primary reason is that nearly 85% of cases present at an advanced stage. Crizotinib is highly effective in treating patients whose NSCLC tumors harbor a rearrangement of the anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) gene. The ALK-FISH assay allows for selection of the subgroup of NSCLC patients who are potentially therapy responsive based on identification of ALK rearrangements at the 2p23 chromosome in the tumor genome. This genetic alteration occurs in 2 to 7% of NSCLC patients. The ALK gene encodes for a transmembrane glycoprotein with tyrosine kinase activity that normally is expressed only in select neuronal cell types. The constitutive kinase activity of ALK is essential for cellular proliferation in this subset of NSCLC. Gene rearrangements in the presence of known fusion partners, including EML4, TFG and KIF5B, result in a chimeric protein with tyrosine kinase activity. In particular the EML4/ALK fusion appears to be a key driver of tumorigenesis in NSCLC. The EML4/ALK fusion also has been identified in about 2.5% of breast and colon carcinomas using exonic sequencing. ALK rearrangements are typically mutually exclusive from EGFR and KRAS mutations, and the majority are found in adenocarcinomas. Patients with tumors exhibiting ALK rearrangements are usually younger, male and light or neversmokers. Lung adenocarcinomas with ALK rearrangement occur in 15% of this population with advanced stage NCSLC. Crizotinib works by blocking certain kinases, including those produced by the abnormal ALK gene. Studies demonstrate crizotinib treatment of patients with tumors exhibiting ALK rearrangements can halt tumor progression or result in tumor regression. Methodology The FISH for ALK ThinPrep NSCLC assay is a qualitative fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) test that detects ALK gene rearrangements with all potential fusion partners, including EML4, TFG and KIF5B. Other available molecular testing methodologies such as RT-PCR detect only the fusion target for which they have been constructed (e.g. EML4/ALK fusion product) and, of course, other potentially clinically significant fusion targets will not be detected. The Abbott Molecular Vysis (AMV) ALK FISH kit was used in one of the two single-arm trials leading to the FDA-approval of crizotinib and has become the gold standard for detecting ALK rearrangement in NSCLC. The AMV ALK Break Apart FISH Probe mixture consists of two fluorophore-labeled DNA probes in hybridization buffer containing dextran sulfate, formamide, and SSC with blocking DNA. The two probes used are Vysis LSI 3 ′-ALK SpectrumOrange and LSI 5 ′-ALK SpectrumGreen. 9500 Euclid Avenue | Cleveland, Ohio 44195 | 216.444.5755 | 800.628.6816 | clevelandcliniclabs.com The ThinPrep version of the test uses cytopathology ThinPrep slides for probe hybridization rather than FFPE tissue sections, with morphologic correlation. Following appropriate specimen preparation, the specimen is hybridized using the probe mixture described above at 37°C for 14 to 24 hours. After washing and counterstaining, slides are evaluated for adequate hybridization. Slides are then assessed for the quality of the ALK signal. Signals from 50 tumor cells from representative areas of the slide are recorded. Depending on the monoclonal antibody and concentration used in IHC, overall sensitivity of IHC for ALK rearrangements ranges from 80 to 95% with specificity of 100%. A testing algorithm using IHC as an initial screening in all cases of NSCLC has been proposed in which ALK IHC 2+ tumor cells would undergo ALK-FISH; 3+ cells would be reported as ALK-positive; 0 and 1+ cells would be reported as ALK-negative. Clinical Indications Patients with late-stage, non-small cell lung cancers may benefit from treatment with crizotinib. The National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN Guidelines™) recognizes FISH as a specifically designed method for diagnosing ALKrearranged adenocarcinomas. These guidelines recommend ALK testing concurrent with EGFR mutation testing in the diagnosis of adenocarcinoma, large cell and other nonspecified histologic subsets of NSCLC. Interpretation When hybridized with the ALK FISH probes, the 2p23 ALK region in its native state will be observed as two immediately adjacent or fused (overlapping) orange/green (yellow) signals. However, if a chromosome rearrangement at the 2p23 ALK breakpoint region has occurred, one orange and one green signal separated by at least three signal diameters will be identified. Alternatively, a single orange signal (deletion of green signal) in addition to a fused or broken apart signal may be observed. Cells are considered negative (non-rearranged) when orange and green signals are adjacent or fused (appear yellow under the Orange/Green V2 filter). A single green signal without a corresponding orange signal is also abnormal, but represents a rearrangement at the 2p23 locus that is not predictive of over-expressed ALK protein. Orange and green signals that are less than three signal diameters apart are classified as a single fused signal. Cells are considered positive for a rearrangement when at least one set of orange and green signals are three or more signal diameters apart, or a single orange signal occurs without a corresponding green signal in addition to fused and/or broken apart signals. Multiple 2p23 signals are often observed as well, indicative of either genomic gain at 2p23 or an aneusomic state for chromosome 2. A sample is classified as positive for ALK rearrangement if 15% or more of tumor cells are positive for the presence of a rearrangement. When the initial signal count identifies >10% but less than 50% of tumor cells positive, another molecular technologist recounts the specimen, and the two counts are averaged. The molecular pathologist reviews the FISH slides and provides the final interpretation. Patients who are ALK-positive are candidates for crizotinib therapy. For patients who are responsive to treatment, crizotinib yields significant clinical benefits. However, not all ALK-positive patients will respond, and those who do will eventually develop resistance to crizotinib. Time-to-drug resistance is unknown as yet; a variety of underlying molecular mechanisms are responsible for development of resistance. Limitations of the Assay FISH for ALK ThinPrep NSCLC is intended to be used for therapeutic purposes in lung cancer. It does not rule out other chromosome abnormalities. Results may indicate likely response to ALK inhibitor therapy, however, selection of treatment remains a clinical decision. References 1. Choi YL, Takeuchi K, Soda M et al.

Patients who are ALK-positive are candidates for crizotinib therapy. For patients who are responsive to treatment, crizotinib yields significant clinical benefits. However, not all ALK-positive patients will respond, and those who do will eventually develop resistance to crizotinib. Time-to-drug resistance is unknown as yet; a variety of underlying molecular mechanisms are responsible for development of resistance. Limitations of the Assay This FISH assay is intended to be used for therapeutic purposes in lung cancer. It does not rule out other chromosome abnormalities. Results may indicate likely response to ALK inhibitor therapy, however, selection of treatment remains a clinical decision. 1. Choi YL, Takeuchi K, Soda M et al.

More recently, specific genetic alterations have been identified in gliomas that have been correlated with prognosis and response to therapy. The majority of oligodendrogliomas show allelic loss of the short arm of chromosome 1 (1p). Patients with anaplastic oligodendrogliomas (WHO Grade III) having 1p loss have been reported to demonstrate better chemotherapeutic response and overall survival than those without 1p loss (Cairncross et al., 1998). Furthermore, combined loss of 1p and the long arm of chromosome 19 (19q) was shown to be a statistically significant predictor of prolonged survival in patients with oligodendrogliomas independent of tumor grade (Smith et al., 2000). Loss of 1p and 19q also occurs in a small percentage of high grade (WHO Grade III and IV) gliomas with astrocytic or mixed oligodendrogliomaastrocytoma histology. Retrospective analysis of these cases suggests a correlation between 1p/19q loss and outcome (Ino et al., 2000; Schmidt et al., 2002). Clinical Indications Cleveland Clinic Laboratories is now offering FISH analysis of chromosomes 1p and 19q to assist in treatment planning for patients with malignant gliomas. The results should be interpreted in the context of the tumor’s clinical, radiographic, and histologic features, as well as any other known genetic information. As noted above, improved prognosis associated with 1p and 19q status has only been clearly demonstrated only in patients with oligodendroglioma histology. Methodology Fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) can be performed on all adequately fixed specimens, even those where the specimen is small in size or contains large areas of non-neoplastic cells in addition to representative tumor areas. The optimal fixative is 10% neutral buffered formalin. For each FISH analysis, a slide is hybridized with a target and a reference probe. Forty cells containing a minimum of two (2) reference probe signals are counted, and the ratio of target to reference probe signals is calculated. 1p FISH: LSI 1p36 / LSI 1q25 Dual Color Probe Set (Abbott Molecular, Vysis, Des Plaines, IL). This is comprised of a mixture of an ~ 400 kb SpectrumOrange labeled 1p36 target probe and an ~ 620 kb SpectrumGreen labeled 1q25 reference probe. The LSI 1p36 probe contains sequences that extend from near SHGC57243 locus, through the TP73 and EGFL3 genes and ends proximally at a point telomeric to the EGFL3 and RH75821 loci. The LSI 1q25 probe contains sequences that extend from a point telomeric to the WI-6848 locus, through the ABL2 and ANGPTL1 genes and ends proximally near the SHGC-1322 locus. 19q FISH: LSI 19p13 / LSI 19q13 Dual Color Probe Set (Abbott Molecular, Vysis, Des Plaines, IL). This is comprised of a mixture of an ~400 kb SpectrumOrange labeled 19q13 target probe and an ~500 kb SpectrumGreen labeled 19p13 reference probe. The LSI 19q13 probe contains sequences that extend from a point telomeric to the CRX locus, through the CRX, GLTSCR2 and GLTSCR1 genes and ends at a point centromeric to the GLTSCR1 locus by the RH76529 locus. The LSI 19p13 probe contains sequences that extend from a point centromeric to MAN2B1 locus, through MAN2B1, ZNF443 and ZNF44 genes and ends proximally at a point telomeric to the ZNF44 and RH92876 loci. Interpretation A target-to-reference probe signal ratio of <0.7 indicates loss of the target allele. A target-to-reference probe signal ratio >0.8 provides no evidence for allelic loss of the target locus. For specimens with ratios between 0.7 and 0.8, the test is repeated. Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) analysis by PCR may be recommended in cases for which the FISH analysis is equivocal. 9500 Euclid Avenue | Cleveland, Ohio 44195 | 216.444.5755 | 800.628.6816 | clevelandcliniclabs.com Cleveland Clinic Laboratories Limitations of the Assay References FISH examines only one locus for each chromosome. Allelic loss at one locus does not necessarily predict the presence of alterations at other loci on the same chromosome, i.e. FISH may not detect partial allelic loss. FISH may not detect allelic losses if there is loss of one allele and replication of the other allele. If more comprehensive locus-specific information is desired, we recommend requesting loss of heterozygosity (LOH) analysis by PCR in addition to FISH. 1. Cairncross JG, Ueki K, Zlatescu MC, et al.

Colorectal cancer can largely be prevented by the detection and removal of adenomatous polyps. Five-year survival is 90% if the disease is diagnosed while still localized, but only 68% for regional disease (disease with lymph node involvement) and only 10% if distant metastases are present.1 In spite of this, a majority of U.S. adults are not receiving regular age- and risk-appropriate screening or have never been screened at all.2 There is a range of options for colorectal cancer screening that includes stool testing for the presence of occult blood or exfoliated DNA, or structural examinations that include flexible sigmoidoscopy, colonoscopy, double contrast barium enema and CR-colonography. Beginning in 1980, the American Cancer Society first issued formal guidelines for colorectal cancer screening in average-risk individuals and these have been periodically updated, along with additional guidelines for high-risk individuals.3 Other organizations such as the American College of Radiology, U.S. Preventive Services Task Force and the U.S. Multi-Society Task Force on Colorectal Cancer have also issued recommendations. Collaborative efforts among these groups took place in 2008 to come to consensus and provide joint guidelines and recommendations.1 There are two major reasons to detect occult blood in the stool, ie., as a screen for colorectal cancer (as mentioned) or to detect upper or lower GI bleeding. In the outpatient settings, an immunochemical-based assay (iFOBT or FIT) will be used to detect fecal occult blood for colorectal cancer screenings. The three-part guaiac-based fecal occult blood test will no longer be available for screening. The single guaiac card (SENSA) will continue to be used for detection of bleeding (upper or lower GI bleeding). The iFOBT (FIT) cannot be used for detection of upper GI bleeding and should only be used as a colon cancer screen test. The HemaPrompt card (a guaiac-based POCT assay) was introduced in October 2009 for use as a point-of-care test for detection of upper and lower GI bleeding. It can be used in the Emergency Department and a few other clinical areas that have been granted POCT testing privileges; if colorectal cancer screening is the intended use of the occult blood test, though, even in these settings, the iFOBT is the preferred method because it is the more sensitive screen and only a single sample collection is required. Occult gastrointestinal bleeding refers to bleeding that is not apparent to the patient. It has traditionally been identified by tests that detect fecal blood or, if bleeding is sufficient, as iron deficiency anemia. A variety of fecal occult-blood (FOB) tests have been designed primarily to screen for colon cancer, including both guaiac-based (gFOB) and immunochemicalbased stool tests (iFOBT or FIT). The likelihood that FOB tests will detect gastrointestinal blood is affected by the type of test utilized, anatomical level of bleeding (upper GI vs. colonic), stool transit time, stool mixing, intra-luminal hemoglobin degradation, and features intrinsic to bleeding lesions (i.e. irregular bleeding).4 One of the main reasons for the change to iFOBT for colorectal cancer screening is due to the fact that the guaiac-based tests lack the sensitivity and specificlty that can be seen with the iFOBT assays. In an early study of iFOBT assays, specimens obtained from 107 colorectal cancer subjects showed that the iFOB test had a 97% sensitivity for detection of colorectal cancer, as compared to a very sensitive guaiacbased test (Hemoccult Sensa) in which the sensitivity was 94%. The iFOBT also demonstrated greater sensitivity (76%) in detecting large adenomas as compared with guaiac-based tests in which the sensitivity was 42%. The specificity of the iFOBT was 97.8% as compared to 96.1% for the gFOB when 1,355 screening tests were performed. The authors concluded that the iFOBT provided the best combination of specificity and sensitivity.5 In a more recent study of performance characteristics for detecting cancer, the sensitivity of the iFOBT test was 81.8% vs. 64.3% with gFOB test. 9500 Euclid Avenue | Cleveland, Ohio 44195 | 216.444.5755 | 800.628.6816 | clevelandcliniclabs.com Specificity for iFOBT was 96.9% and 97.3%, respectively, for detecting cancer and adenomas vs. 90% and 90.6% with gFOB. For the detection of large polyps, the sensitivity of the gFOB was actually higher than that with iFOBT in this study.6 In a recent study out of Seoul, Korea, a population of average risk individuals (770 patients from four centers) undergoing colorectal cancer screening were assayed for occult blood comparing a gFOB to an iFOB. The iFOBT provided a higher sensitivity for detecting cancer and advanced colorectal neoplasia than the gFOB and had an acceptable specificity that could significantly reduce the need for colonoscopic evaluation of the screened population.7 An editorial in the same issue of the journal from Seoul suggested that the data supported an effort to increase use of iFOBT assays in the U.S. and publishing of studies in average-risk individuals here as well.8 Secondly, various foods and exogenous substances can yield false positive guaiac-based FOB test results. Vitamin C in excess of 250 mg/day from all sources (dietary and supplemental) can oxidize guaiac. False positive guaiac-based test results can also occur with excess dietary red meat (beef, lamb, processed meat, liver) or plant peroxidases contained in raw fruits and vegetables (especially radishes, turnips, horseradish, cantaloupes and other melons.) Such foods should be avoided for 72 hours prior to testing. GI bleeding can be induced by alcohol, and also has well-known iatrogenic causes, such as steroids and NSAIDS.9 The iFOBT assays detect human globin, a protein that along with heme constitutes human hemoglobin. It is more specific for human blood as compared to the guaiac-based tests and is not subject to the false negative results seen in the guaiac-based tests in the presence of high dose vitamin C supplements. It is important to remember that the iFOBT assays are specific to bleeding in the lower GI tract. Thirdly, because of the increased sensitivity of these assays, only one sample is usually required for screening as compared to the three samples needed when guaiac-based tests are used. The ease of use of these screening assays should enhance patient compliance. Interpretation Results of the iFOBT assays will be: • Positive: samples with a hemoglobin concentration >/=100 ng/ml. • Negative: samples with a hemoglobin concentration of <100 ng/ml. Because gastrointestinal lesions may bleed intermittently and blood in feces is not distributed uniformly, a negative result may not assure absence of a lesion. Limitations Patients with the following conditions should not be tested due to a potential for false positive results: bleeding hemorrhoids, menstrual bleeding, constipation bleeding and urinary bleeding. Certain medications such as aspirin and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs may cause gastrointestinal irritation and subsequent bleeding in some patients and cause false positive results. Contamination of the sample with urine or toilet water also may cause erroneous results. The OC-Sensor Diana iFOBT should not be used for testing urine, gastric or other body fluids. Because iFOB (FIT) tests are dependent on the intact antigenic structure of heme molecules, its use is limited to screening for FOB that is not gastric or upper GI in origin. Bulk stool samples should not be sent to the lab for occult blood testing, as hemoglobin present in stool begins to degrade within hours of passage. Methodology The OC-Sensor Diana iFOB test is an immunoassay-based test that uses rabbit polyclonal antibodies to detect hemoglobin in stool. The test is a turbidimetric latex agglutination test. Hemoglobin present in the patient sample will combine with latex-coated antibody to cause a change in absorbance. A light beam is passed through the reaction cells and measures changes in the intensity of light beam. Testing is performed on an automated analyzer and qualitative results are generated. Patients for whom a colorectal cancer screening test is ordered will be given a collection “kit,” which is composed of a “labeled collection vial,” instructions on how to collect the stool sample and inoculate the vial, and an envelope into which the vial can be placed and sent back to Cleveland Clinic Laboratories for testing on the OC-Sensor Diana. Testing is performed on a daily basis, Monday through Friday. References 1. Levin B, Lieberman DA, McFarland B et al.

The variables are age, gender, ethnicity, and serum creatinine. Because the eGFR can be automated as part of routine lab reporting, the National Kidney Foundation (NKF) recommends automatically reporting it with all serum creatinine measurements (http://www.kidney.org). eGFR already is in use by many clinical laboratories. The NKF defines CKD as the presence for longer than 3 months of either of the following: 1. An eGFR of less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 or 2. Other evidence of kidney damage (e.g. albuminuria, proteinuria) independent of GFR level. CKD is estimated to affect approximately 13.1% of the adult American population. CKD has been shown to be an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease, mortality and progression to end stage renal disease. Therefore, early detection and treatment of CKD is important. The use of serum creatinine alone to assess kidney function results in unrecognized CKD in a large number of patients, particulary in women and elderly patients who typically have lower serum creatinine values than other patient populations with the same GFR. In such cases, CKD may be missed because a presumed “normal” serum creatinine value will correlate with a lower GFR. Clinical Indications To support the effort the National Kidney Foundation’s initiative to identify CKD in its early stages, Cleveland Clinic Laboratories reports eGFR on each serum creatinine reported for outpatients. The eGFR also can be ordered for inpatients. Interpretation Based on the NKF’s “K/DOQI Clinical Practice Guidelines for Chronic Kidney Disease: Evaluation, Classification, and Stratification,” the eGFR should be used for diagnosis and monitoring of CKD. The interpretation of any laboratory information should be done in the context of the patient evaluation. The classification of CKD is as follows: Stage eGFR+ (mL/min/1.73m2) Evidence of Kidney Damage* Required? 1 >90 Yes 2 60-89 Yes 3 30-59 No 4 15-29 No 5 <15 (or dialysis) No Notes: +These abnormalities must be present for > 3 months to meet the definition of chronic kidney disease. * Evidence of kidney damage includes abnormal pathologic, blood, urine or radiologic studies. Limitations of the Assay The National Kidney Disease Education Program (NKDEP) recommends reporting estimated eGFR values greater than or equal to 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 as “≥60 mL/min/1.73 m2”. This is based on the fact that, at higher ranges of kidney function, changes in GFR are reflected by little-to-no change in serum creatinine. As a result, the MDRD eGFR is much less accurate in this range. 9500 Euclid Avenue | Cleveland, Ohio 44195 | 216.444.5755 | 800.628.6816 | clevelandcliniclabs.com Cleveland Clinic Laboratories In addition, the MDRD equation has not been validated in subjects <18 years old (see Methodology below) or hospitalized patients. The eGFR will not yield accurate results in subjects with extremes of body habitus/muscle mass, with renal function not at steady state (e.g. acute renal failure), or with critical illness admitted to the hospital. In these clinical situations, kidney function assessment is to be made on clinical grounds. Analysis for PNH is best done within 24 hours of the stated draw time. Blood older than 48 hours from draw time cannot be analyzed. Methodology re-expressed four-variable MDRD study equation which for Scr (mg/dL) is GFR = 175 x Scr-1.154 x age-0.203 x 1.212 (if black) x 0.742 (if female). The eGFR for children is calculated based on the Schwartz equation which for Scr (mg/dL) and height (cm) is GFR (mL/min/1.73m2) = k * height /Scr with k= 0.55 except that male > 13 years k= 0.7. The eGFR is reported for outpatients with any serum creatinine order either as a single test or as part of a chemistry panel, i.e., Comprehensive Metabolic Panel (CMP), Basic Metabolic Panel (BMP), etc. Suggested Reading The serum creatinine method used in our laboratory is traceable to a primary material at the NIST based on isotope dilution mass spectrometry.

NSCLC includes adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma and large-cell carcinoma. NSCLC tumors are also categorized according to molecular criteria. Patients with advanced, non-treated NCSLC should have their tumor tested for EGFR mutations to guide first-line therapy, such as treatment with EGFR TKIs or chemotherapy. Activating mutations in EGFR occur in exons 18 to 21, which encode the kinase domain. These mutations are usually heterozygous, and amplification of the mutant allele can also occur.1 The most common activating mutations found in EGFR are deletions in exon 19 centered around four amino acids (LREA) at positions 747–750, and a missense mutation (L858R) arising as a result of the leucine to arginine amino acid substitution at position 858 within exon 21. Together, these account for approximately 90% of TKI-sensitive mutations within the EGFR-mutant tumors.1,7 The L861Q mutation in exon 21 and the substitution of glycine at position 719 in exon 18 with alanine (G719A), serine (G719S) or cysteine (G719C) also confer increased sensitivity to EGFR TKIs,7,8 although these are much less common. Together, the activating mutations are associated with response rates of approximately 70% when treated with erlotinib or gefitinib.9 The S768I mutation in exon 20 is a rare mutation, which has also been reported to confer sensitivity to TKIs, although at a lower level than the L858R mutation or exon 19 deletions.7 Analysis of the crystal structures of L858R and G719S EGFR mutant proteins demonstrated that the kinase is activated through disruption of autoinhibitory interactions, resulting in receptors with 50-fold more activity compared to wild-type EGFR receptors.1 Recent studies have shown that patients with tumors harboring exon 19 deletions are associated with longer time to progression (TTP) and overall survival (OS) when compared with L858R point mutations,9 presumably due to greater sensitivity to TKI treatments. Lung cancers harboring mutations in the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) have demonstrated some success in responding to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors. EGFR-mutant NSCLC is defined as a distinct, clinically relevant subset of lung cancer. EGFR-mutant tumors are histologically similar to adenocarcinomas, and are often associated with better prognosis than EGFR wild-type tumors, due primarily to their increased sensitivity to tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) such as erlotinib (Tarceva from Genentech and OSI Pharmaceuticals) or gefitinib (Iressa from AstraZeneca). These two drugs have demonstrated an increase in progression-free and overall survival in patients who receive EGFR-TKI therapy as a first-line therapy for the treatment of NSCLC. However, not all mutations in the EGFR gene confer sensitivity to TKIs, and primary resistance is still observed. Therefore, the mutation status of EGFR can be a useful marker by which patients are selected for EGFR-targeted therapy. EGFR is a transmembrane receptor belonging to the ERBB family of receptor tyrosine kinases, which also includes HER2, HER3 and HER4. After ligand binding, the EGFR receptor forms a dimer that activates receptor autophosphorylation through tyrosine kinase activity, which triggers a series of intracellular pathways that may result in cancer-cell proliferation, blocking apoptosis, activating invasion and metastasis, and stimulating tumor-induced neovascularization.2,6 Small-molecule EGFR TKIs inhibit EGFR autophosphorylation and downstream signaling by reversibly competing with ATP to bind to the intracellular catalytic domain of EGFR tyrosine kinase.2 Mutations in exons 18 to 21 can also be associated with decreased sensitivity or primary resistance to TKIs. Small insertions or duplications in exon 20 (including D770_ N771insG) have been shown to be less sensitive to TKIs than exon 19 deletion and L858R mutants. In fact, most patients with these mutations show progressive disease while undergoing TKI therapy.1 Acquired resistance can also arise, and despite an initial response to EGFR TKI therapy, patients with EGFR mutations rarely achieve a complete radiographic or pathologic response. 9500 Euclid Avenue | Cleveland, Ohio 44195 | 216.444.5755 | 800.628.6816 | clevelandcliniclabs.com Prolonged TKI treatment provides a selective pressure for the development of tumor cells with acquired resistance to gefitinib or erlotinib.8 The T790M mutation that arises as a result of the substitution of threonine to methionine at position 790 in exon 20 has been found in 50% of patients with EGFR-mutant tumors who develop acquired resistance to TKIs.1,3,4,8 This phenomenon is also seen in chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) cells harboring ABL translocations and gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) cells harboring activating KIT mutations, whereby the threonine gatekeeper residues are substituted with bulkier isoleucine residues that alter drug binding in both ABL (T315I) and KIT (T670I).1 The T790M mutation is rare, occurring in <5% of untreated EGFR-mutant tumors, but is detected as a second site mutation in half of patients who develop acquired resistance to EGFR TKI therapy.1 Evidence exists to show that acquired resistance can be lost after a period without TKI therapy,1,5 however the mechanisms involved in this are not yet fully understood, and a recommendation regarding discontinuation of EGFR TKI therapy after developing acquired resistance has not yet been made. Collectively, these results deepen our understanding of resistance to EGFR inhibitors and underscore the importance of repeatedly assessing cancers throughout the course of the disease. Numerous studies and trials have emphasized the importance of using genomic assessments of EGFR rather than using clinical characteristics, as the former is more accurate in selecting a group of patients with increased chance of sensitivity to EGFR-TKI therapy.9 Methodology The EGFR Mutation Analysis assay is an allele specific polymerase chain reaction (ASPCR) assay performed on the Rotor-Gene® Q 5plex HRM® instrument (Qiagen) using two Table 1: NSCLC Predictive Testing — Mutations detected by the EGFR Mutation Analysis Assay Exon Mutation COSMIC ID Base Change (CDS Mutation) G719A G719S Sensitive to EGFR TKI treatment 1, 7, 8 G719C 6239 6252 6253 c.2156G>C c.2155G>A c.2155G>T Deletions 19 Sensitive to EGFR TKI treatment 1, 7, 9 in exon 19 6223 13551 12728 12678 12367 12384 6225 6220 12422 12419 6218 6254 6255 12382 12387 6210 12370 12369 12383 c.2235_2249del15 c.2235_2252>AAT (complex) c.2236_2253del18 c.2237_2251del15 c.2237_2254del18 c.2237_2255>T (complex) c.2236_2250del15 c.2238_2255del18 c.2238_2248>GC (complex) c.2238_2252>GCA (complex) c.2239_2247del9 c.2239_2253del15 c.2239_2256del18 c.2239_2248TTAAGAGAAG>C (complex) c.2239_2258>CA (complex) c.2240_2251del12 c.2240_2257del18 c.2240_2254del15 c.2239_2251>C (complex) 18 EGFR TKI Therapy Response References Associated with Mutation 12376 Insertions Lack of responsiveness 20 1 12377 in exon 20 to EGFR TKIs 12378 20 T790M 20 S768I c.2307_2308ins9 c.2319_2320insCAC c.2310_2311insGGT Amino Acid Change p.G719A p.G719S p.G719C p.E746_A750del p.E746_T751>I p.E746_T751del p.E746_T751>A p.E746_S752>A p.E746_S752>V p.E746_A750del p.E746_S752>D p.L747_A750>P p.L747_T751>Q p.L747_E749del p.L747_T751del p.L747_S752del p.L747_A750>P p.L747_P753>Q p.L747_T751>S p.L747_P753>S p.L747_T751del p.L747_T751>P p.V769_D770insASV p.H773_V774insH p.D770_N771insG Resistance to EGFR TKIs 1, 3, 4, 5, 8 6240 c.2369C>T p.T790M Low level sensitivity to EGFR TKI treatment 7 6241 c.2303G>T p.S768I 21 L858R Sensitive to EGFR TKI treatment 1, 7 6224 c.2573T>G p.L858R 21 L861Q Sensitive to EGFR TKI treatment 7, 8 6213 c.2582T>A p.L861Q technologies – Scorpions and ARMS® – to qualitatively detect the following 29 somatic mutations (full details in Table 1) against a background of wild-type genomic DNA: detecting mutations in samples containing at least 10% mutant allele. This is representative of 20% tumor within a heterogeneous sample containing tumor and non-tumor cells. • 19 deletions in exon 19 (detects the presence of any of the 19 deletions, but does not distinguish between them). When using ARMS primers, some inefficient priming may occur, giving a very late background CT from DNA not containing a mutation. All CT values calculated from background amplification will be greater than the cut-off ΔCT values and the samples will be classed as mutation negative.10 This is particularly noticeable in the T790M mutation reaction, due to the fact that the T790M mutation is found in a very GC rich region. With primer design, GC content is critical for PCR efficiency. The sensitivity of the T790M assay is affected due to an increased limit of blank (LOB), which only allows an increased % of mutant to be discriminately detected. In the assay, this reflects itself in a lower ΔCT cut-off, and the potential for ‘breakthrough’ (non-specific) amplification late in the reaction. • T790M. • L858R. • L861Q. • G719X (detects the presence of any of G719S, G719A or G719C, but does not distinguish between them). • S768I. • 3 insertions in exon 20 (detects the presence of any of 3 insertions but does not distinguish between them). The ARMS® (Amplification Refractory Mutation System) technology achieves allele- or mutation-specific amplification. Taq DNA polymerase is effective at distinguishing between a match and a mismatch at the 3’ end of a PCR primer. Specific mutated sequences are selectively amplified, even in samples where the majority of the sequences do not carry the mutation. When the primer is fully matched, the amplification proceeds with full efficiency. When the 3’ base is mismatched, only low level background amplification occurs.10 Scorpions, or bi-functional molecules containing a PCR primer covalently linked to a probe, are used to detect amplification. The fluorophore in this probe interacts with a quencher, also incorporated into the probe, which reduces fluorescence. During PCR, when the probe binds to the amplicon, the fluorophore and quencher become separated. This leads to an increase in fluorescence from the reaction tube.10 A total of seven mutation reactions, each labeled with FAM are performed. Each mutation reaction contains Scorpion probes plus primers for discrimination between the wild-type DNA and mutant DNA detected by real time PCR. A control reaction (a region of exon 2 for which the primers and probe have been designed to avoid any known EGFR polymorphisms), also labeled in FAM, is performed to assess the amount of amplifiable DNA in the sample and to calculate the difference in cycle threshold (ΔCT) between the mutation reaction and the control reaction from the same sample. Interpretation of Results A sample is considered mutation positive if the ΔCT is less than the cut-off ΔCT for that mutation reaction. Above this value, the sample may either contain less than the percentage of mutant DNA detectable by the assay, or the sample does not contain that specific mutation. The assay is capable of Specimen Preparation Up to 10 unstained slides cut at a thickness of 7µm on unbaked microscope slides plus the pre- and post-H&E stained sections with the best tumor area circled by a pathologist are needed to perform the EGFR mutation analysis assay. The number of slides required will vary, depending on the size of the tumor area. Alternatively, cellular material obtained from the patient’s lungs by fine needle aspiration and preserved in CytoLyt solution can be used. Such material should be stored at 4°C for up to 2 weeks prior to analysis. The specimen submitted for analysis should contain >20% tumor cells, as determined by microscopic examination of ThinPrep slides, H&E stained slide or other slides. Limitations of the Assay A validation panel consisting of 100 specimens was used to assess the clinical performance of the EGFR Mutation Analysis assay. This consisted of samples for which EGFR mutation status had been determined by analysis at external CLIAcertified laboratories. Sensitivity of the assay greatly depends on the extent of fragmentation and quality of the isolated DNA. References 1.

Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae remain as two of the most common causes of STDs in the United States.1 C. trachomatis infections have comprised the largest proportion of all STDs reported to the CDC since 1994 with a reported 1,244,180 cases in 2009 for a rate of 409.2/100,000 population. This was a 2.8% increase in rate from that reported in 2008.1,2 The increase in reported chlamydial infections during the last 20 years reflects the expansion of chlamydia screening activities and the use of increasingly sensitive assays for the detection of C. trachomatis. The CDC recommends annual chlamydia screening of all sexually active women younger than 25 years of age.3 In 2009, there were 301,174 cases of N. gonorrhoeae infections reported for a rate of 99.1/100,000 population. This rate was a 10.5% decrease since 2008. The national gonorrhea rate declined by 74% between 1975 and 1997 following implementation of a national gonorrhea control program in the mid-1970s. However, since 1997, these rates have reached a plateau and are not continuing to decline.1,2 Infections due to both Chlamydia trachomatis and N. gonorrhoeae are a major cause of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) in the U.S. and both have been shown to facilitate the transmission of HIV as well. More rapid and sensitive methods for the laboratory diagnosis of these two agents have been developed and make it reasonable to test for both agents simultaneously when the diagnosis of an STD is being considered.2 The estimate of mixed infections with both agents can be as high as 40%, making it important to consider ordering both agents when sending material off to the laboratory for testing. Nucleic acid amplification tests (NAAT) are recommended for detection of reproductive tract infections caused by C. trachomatis and N. gonorrhoeae infections in men and women with and without symptoms. NAAT should be used for diagnosing both C. trachomatis and N. gonorrhoeae in women with cervicitis; testing can be performed on vaginal, cervical or urine samples. In men with urethritis, NAAT testing of urine or urethral swabs is recommended.3 Clinical Indications Both C. trachomatis and N. gonorrhoeae cause urethritis in the male and cervicitis in the female. A significant number of cases, however, remain asymptomatic in both males and females. In addition, both can cause epididymitis and rectal infections in the male and PID in the female. Neonates, who contract chlamydial infection during birth, can develop inclusion conjunctivitis and/or pneumoniae; pregnant women can infect their newborns causing ophthalmia neonatorum; gonorrheal infections can produce joint infections, pharyngitis and disseminated disease. Cleveland Clinic Laboratories offers a target amplification nucleic acid probe, APTIMA, Gen-Probe, Inc, San Diego, CA) for the laboratory diagnosis of C. trachomatis and N. gonorrhoeae from urethral and urine specimens from males suspected of these infections and in cervical, vaginal and urine samples from females suspected of the infection. Numerous articles have been published demonstrating the excellent performance of NAAT testing for diagnosis of both of these STD agents.4-8 Methodology The laboratory diagnosis of Neisseria gonorrhoeae can include culture of urethral or cervical specimens, gram stain of the urethral secretions in symptomatic males, detection by specific nucleic acid gene probes and amplification of N. gonorrhoeae nucleic acids. Amplification of N. gonorrhoeae nucleic acids has been shown to be a very sensitive and specific method of detection.4,5 The sensitivity is equivalent 9500 Euclid Avenue | Cleveland, Ohio 44195 | 216.444.5755 | 800.628.6816 | clevelandcliniclabs.com to culture, but it is not fraught by the problem of organism fragility that can easily occur with delays in transport. Although culture or the use of a nucleic acids probe can be employed for the detection of C. trachomatis, nucleic acid amplification is the most sensitive method with studies indicating that it may be up to 40% more sensitive than culture. The same assay that detects Chlamydia trachomatis nucleic acids is also used to detect Neisseria gonorrhoeae nucleic acids in Cleveland Clinic Laboratories, thus providing a convenient approach to dual detection. Specimen Collection and Transport Acceptable specimens include urine, vaginal, urethral and endocervical swabs. A vaginal swab is optimal for screening asymptomatic females, while a first-catch urine is optimal for screening asymptomatic men. Collect swabs using the appropriate Aptima collection kits [APTIMA vaginal swab #389073; APTIMA urine specimen collection kit #150663; APTIMA unisex (urethral or endocervical) swab collection kit #150664]. Swabs in viral transport media (M4) are acceptable, but may reduce test sensitivity. Specimen collection/transport using APTIMA devices is preferred. The APTIMA Unisex Swab Specimen collection kit for urethral or endocervical specimens contains a white cleaning swab to be used for removing excess mucus. The blue swab must be used for collection of specimens that are submitted for testing. For urethral specimens, patients should not urinate within 1 hour prior to specimen collection. Insert the blue shaft swab 2 to 4 cm into the urethra. Gently rotate swab clockwise for 2 to 3 seconds and withdraw carefully. For endocervical specimens, remove excess mucus using cleaning swab and then insert blue shaft swab into the endocervical canal. Rotate swab for 10-30 seconds in the endocervical canal to ensure adequate sampling and withdraw carefully (avoid contact with vaginal mucosa). Place swab in transport tube and carefully break at score line. Use care to avoid splashing contents. Discard top portion of swab shaft and recap transport tube tightly. Maintain specimen at 2ºC to 30ºC. When collecting vaginal specimens, hold the swab with forefinger and thumb covering the score line. Do not hold the shaft below the score line. Carefully insert the swab into the vagina about 2 inches and gently rotate the swab for 10-30 seconds. Make sure the swab touches the walls of the vagina so that moisture is absorbed by the swab and then withdraw the swab without touching the skin. While holding the swab in the same hand, unscrew the cap from the tube being careful not to spill contents of the tube. Immediately place the swab in the transport tube and carefully break swab shaft at score line against side of tube. Discard the top portion of swab shaft. Tightly screw cap onto tube. Maintain specimen at 2ºC to 30ºC. If a urine specimen is collected, the patient should not have urinated within one hour of collection. Collect the first catch urine (approximately 20-30 ml of initial urine stream; collection of larger volumes of urine will reduce test sensitivity). Within 24 hours of collection, transfer 2 ml of urine into the APTMA urine transport tube using the disposable pipette provided in the collection kit. The correct volume of urine has been added when the fluid level is between the black lines on the transport tube label. Maintain urine specimen at 2ºC to 30ºC. Alternatively, if a ThinPrep vial is being used for Liquid Cytology PAP Test, the same sample can be submitted for detection of C. trachomatis and N. gonorrhoeae as well.9 The assay can only be performed on Thin Preps if 1 ml Cytyc PreservCyt Solution is transferred to the APTIMA Specimen Transfer Tube (#367648) before the specimen is processed in Cytology for a PAP test. Interpretation Amplification is performed Monday through Friday. Internal controls are run with each specimen in order to detect any inhibitors in the sample. Results will be reported as “positive for C. trachomatis and/ or N. gonorrhoeae by amplification” when the relative light unit (RLU) result is above our positive cutoff value. Within a narrow range of RLU results, as determined by the assay manufacturer, an “equivocal result” will be reported with a request that a repeat specimen be submitted. If the internal control indicates inhibition and the result is negative for C. trachomatis and/or N. gonorrhoeae, the report will be: “inhibition detected; N. gonorrhoeae, and/or C. trachomatis, if present, would not be detectable. Please send an additional specimen.” All results for N. gonorrhoeae and/or C. trachomatis that are lower than the lab’s derived positive cutoff, but within the instrument derived positive results, will be confirmed with a repeat amplification assay before reports are released. This is done to avoid any problems with false positive results that might occur with low positive results.10 Limitations of the Assay There is currently no FDA clearance for use of amplification assays on specimens outside of the genitourinary tract. Culture is recommended for testing specimens from the throat, eye or rectal area. However, a laboratory can validate use of NAAT for rectal and pharyngeal specimens. In addition, for specimens obtained from infants and children, or if the information from the laboratory is to be used for legal purposes, culture is the preferred method.7 Since NAAT is more sensitive, it may be run in conjunction with culture for purposes of treatment decision-making. Although “test-ofcure” samples are not recommended from patients in whom the diagnosis has previously been made within the last 4-6 weeks, if required, a culture is the preferred request. If a culture is needed for any of these purposes, the collection swab for Neisseria gonorrhoeae needs to be placed into a culturette and not the Aptima transport tube and a specific request for culture should be made.

HSV disease can range from the usual mild illness, indistinguishable in most patients, to sporadic, severe and life-threatening disease in infants. Infections with HSV-1 and HSV-2 can differ somewhat in their clinical manifestations and severity. HSV-1 is more frequently associated with orolabial infection (cold sores), whereas HSV-2 primarily is more frequently associated with urogenital infections in adults. Although there are differences in the frequency of infections at particular sites, in reality, both viral subtypes can cause either of these diseases.1 and detection results in improved patient care. This test should not be used to screen patients exhibiting no signs or symptoms supportive of an HSV infection. Limitations of the Assay Although HSV PCR represents a significant advance in the diagnosis of HSV CNS disease, a negative result does not eliminate the possibility of HSV infection. In some patients, HSV DNA may only be present in cerebrospinal fluid for three to four weeks after initial presentation of symptoms, and DNA levels may be undetectable over a period of time. Although false positive results may occur, they are rare. Repeat testing should be considered for patients with a low likelihood of HSV infection, if a false-positive reaction is suspected. HSV also can cause viral central nervous system (CNS) disease. For example, HSV-1 is the most common cause of sporadic encephalitis that, if left untreated, has a high mortality rate. HSV-2 is a cause of meningitis, which occurs most frequently among young adults. Both HSV subtypes are also a cause of neonatal disease acquired during exposure of the infant to HSV-infected secretions during birth. Methodology Early and rapid diagnosis of HSV meningitis/meningoencephalitis is important to direct therapy and minimize the suffering in affected patients. It also helps to reduce empiric antibacterial therapy and the likelihood of side effects from unnecessary therapy. In the past, diagnosis relied on brain biopsy. Fortunately, new molecular diagnostic tests such as rapid cycle PCR on cerebrospinal fluid have virtually replaced the need for brain biopsy.2 The PCR test detects viral DNA in specimens, and is quicker, safer, and more sensitive and specific than earlier methods. Cleveland Clinic Laboratories uses rapid cycle PCR, which is considered the gold standard, for detection of HSV in CSF specimens. Clinical Indications Laboratory testing with PCR is routinely used as an aid in the diagnosis of HSV infections for patients with meningitis and meningoencephalitis. Despite its prevalence, HSV remains an underdiagnosed disease, and early diagnosis A polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test on spinal fluid can detect the genetic material (DNA) of the HSV virus. This assay also differentiates the HSV-1 and HSV-2 subtypes. Nucleic acid amplification assays, such as PCR, are the best methods for testing spinal fluid for the presence of HSV, when HSV meningitis or meningoencephalitis is suspected. References 1.

The annual incidence of pulmonary embolism in the United States is estimated at 100,000 to 300,000 cases.1 Symptoms of venous thromboembolism or deep vein thrombosis (DVT) include pain and swelling in the affected arm or leg and associated erythema, tenderness and warmth in the affected limb and calf pain on foot dorsiflexion. Symptoms typically are unilateral. Symptoms of pulmonary embolism include dyspnea, pleuritic chest pain, hemoptysis, low-grade fever, and tachycardia. The D-dimer has proven most useful in patients suspected of having pulmonary embolism and who have a low pretest probability of disease. Use of the Wells Criteria has shown to be a reliable and reproducible means of determining this pretest probability. While DVT cannot be completely ruled out or confirmed with the Wells Criteria, it can help inform interpretation of subsequent diagnostic tests and reduce the need for invasive testing. An estimated 70 percent of patients presenting in the emergency room with symptoms of DVT do not have the disorder.1 Therefore, a means for rapidly and accurately differentiating between patients with DVT and those without is critical to defining subsequent appropriate therapy to prevent pulmonary embolism. Several techniques have been proposed in the past decade for detecting small, deep thrombi, including CT venography, duplex scanning and MRI. These techniques, while effective, are time-consuming, expensive and, in the case of CT venography, expose patients to radiation.2 The D-dimer assay offers a rapid, non-invasive, relatively inexpensive in vitro method to rule out venous thromboembolism, DVT or pulmonary embolism. The assay provides a quantitative measure of D-dimer. For suspected DVT, a D-dimer level below 500 ng/mL FEU has a Negative Predictive Value (NPV) of 99.2% and a sensitivy of 98.9 %. For suspected pulmunary embolism, a D-dimer below 500 ng/mL FEU has a NPV of 99.1% and a sensitivity of 97.8%. The initial insult to the vein initiates the coagulation cascade. Fibrin produced during this process, together with platelet, forms the thrombus at the site of injury. During subsequent fibrinolysis, plasmin cleaves factor XIIIa–crosslinked fibrin into several intermediate forms, including D-dimer fragments. D-dimer fragments, resulting from terminal fibrin degradation, are composed of smaller segments of crosslinked fibrin and are produced only during fibrinolysis. Under normal conditions, D-dimer is undetectable in the blood. Therefore, D-dimer is a marker for intravascular coagulation, and its presence in the blood is suggestive of thrombosis. To make a definitive diagnosis of venous thromboembolism, DVT or pulmonary embolism, patients with an elevated D-dimer should undergo additional testing such as ultrasonography, ventilation perfusion lung scan and chest computed tomography (CT).3 Clinical Indications Rule out venous thromboembolism, DVT or pulmonary embolism in the presence of risk factors and clinical symptoms. Interpretation Negative: D-dimer < 500 ng/ml. Limitations of the Assay D-dimer should not be used as a stand-alone test. Elevated D-dimer may be due to recent surgery, trauma, or infection. Elevated levels are also seen with liver disease, pregnancy, eclampsia, cardiovascular disease, and some cancers. 9500 Euclid Avenue | Cleveland, Ohio 44195 | 216.444.5755 | 800.628.6816 | clevelandcliniclabs.com Cleveland Clinic Laboratories References 1.

It also can occur as an acquired bleeding disorder. VWD is a clinically heterogeneous disorder with several subtypes due to deficiency and/or dysfunction of von Willebrand factor (VWF). VWF is a multimeric adhesive glycoprotein that plays a major role in primary hemostasis and coagulation. VWF mediates adhesion of platelets to injured subendothelium and to the platelet surface receptor GPIb and serves as the specific carrier protein for coagulation factor VIII (fVIII) in plasma preventing proteolytic degradation. The revised classification of VWD identified two major categories, quantitative and qualitative defects. The quantitative VWF defects include type 1 (partial deficiency of VWF) and type 3 (complete absence of VWF) in plasma and/or platelets. Type 2 is a qualitative VWF defect that is further classified as four subtypes by different pathophysiologic mechanisms. Accurate laboratory diagnosis and classification of VWD using both quantitative (antigenic) and qualitative (functional) assays based on the VWD diagnostic algorithm (see page 3) are crucial because the presenting biological activity of VWF determines both the hemorrhagic risk and subsequent clinical management. Clinical Indications The functional activity of VWF traditionally has been assessed using the ristocetin cofactor activity (RiCof) assay, which measures the VWF-mediated agglutination of platelets in the presence of ristocetin. However, the usefulness of this assay has limitations due to poor reproducibility and lack of calibration. The collagen binding activity (CBA) assay has been proposed as a supplemental test for VWF activity. The CBA assay is based on the ability of multimeric forms of VWF to bind collagen, and its greatest strength lies in the ability to selectively detect primarily high molecular weight (HMW) forms of VWF, which are known to be most functional and adhesive. The CBA assay is a useful adjunctive to the RiCof assay for the diagnosis of VWD and to differentiate VWD with deficiency of HMW multimer forms in type 2A and type 2B from type 1. It also can differentiate very low levels of VWF in severe type 1 from complete absence of VWF in type 3 and has been reported as a better marker for therapeutic efficacy of treatment with DDAVP® (desmopressin) and fVIII concentrate. Interpretation CBA results are reported as % of the reference value for CBA. CBA to VWF:Ag ratio is calculated to provide a ratio of VWF activity to protein amount. 1. Type 1 VWD patients have concordantly decreased CBA and VWF:Ag levels. 2. Type 3 VWD patients have markedly decreased or nearly absent CBA and VWF:Ag levels. 3. Type 2A VWD and type 2B VWD patients have discordantly decreased CBA and VWF:Ag levels with markedly decreased CBA level, normal or decreased VWF:Ag level and loss of HMW multimers. 9500 Euclid Avenue | Cleveland, Ohio 44195 | 216.444.5755 | 800.628.6816 | clevelandcliniclabs.com 4. Type 2M VWD patients have a discordantly decreased CBA level with a normal or decreased VWF:Ag level but without the loss of HMW multimers. 5. Type 2N VWD patients have normal CBA and VWF:Ag with discordantly decreased FVIII coagulant activity. 6. CBA values are known to be lower in O blood groups compared with non-O blood groups. However, as VWF:Ag levels show similar blood group dependence, the ratio of CBA/VWF:Ag is not affected. Methodology The CBA assay is an enzyme immunoassay (REAADS® Collagen Binding Assay ELISA kit, Corgenix, Inc., Broomfield, Colo.) that quantitates the binding of VWF to a collagen-coated microwell plate. After binding peroxidaseconjugated anti-VWF antibodies to VWF multimers, the resulting color intensity is determined photometrically, which is proportional to HMW forms of VWF present in the plasma. In situ evaluation for precision and accuracy of the CBA assay shows low coefficient of variation (6.3-11.1%) with lower limit of detection 0.2% (linearity 1-530%). Specimen Collection and Handling Collection of blood by routine venipuncture in a 3.5ml light blue top tube containing 9:1 ratio of blood to 3.2% trisodium citrate anticoagulant. Pediatric volume of 2.5ml with an appropriate ratio of anticoagulant is acceptable. Specimens other than 3.2% trosodium citrate plasma and those that are improperly collected, stored, misidentified or of insufficient volume are unacceptable.

The entire CEBPA coding region is amplified by PCR and analyzed by Sanger sequencing. AML with mutated CEBPA displays distinct clinicopathologic features including a favorable clinical course, and the identification of CEBPA mutations may assist in treatment selection.2-6 CEBPA mutation analysis is recommended for cases of AML with normal cytogenetics in current National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) and European LeukemiaNet guidelines. Clinical Indications Cleveland Clinic Laboratories offers CEBPA mutation analysis for classification and prognostic assessment of new acute myeloid leukemias, especially those with normal cytogenetics. Concurrent NPM1 and FLT3 studies are also recommended (see Acute Myeloid Leukemia Mutation Profile technical brief). Interpretation Mutations in CEBPA include single and dual (usually biallelic) mutations. Initial studies reported that the presence of any CEBPA mutation was associated with a favorable clinical course, while more recent studies have suggested that the favorable clinical course and distinctive clinicopathologic features are limited to AML with dual CEBPA mutations.2-6 All identified mutations are reported, and cases are classified as wild type (no mutations detected), single mutated or dual mutated. Limitations of the Assay Sanger sequencing is expected to identify >99% of mutations, provided that mutations represent at least 15-20% of total CEBPA alleles.

BRAF is a downstream effector of the RAS/RAF/ MAPK/MEK signaling pathway. Signal transduction often is initiated via ligand binding of transmembrane receptors such as epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) or platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR), but there are many upstream activators of the RAS/RAF/MAPK/MEK pathway. The T1799A point mutation causes the V600E transversion in exon 15 of BRAF gene located at the 7q34 locus. This valine to glutamine mutation accounts for the vast majority of oncogenic BRAF mutations, and BRAF mutational analysis serves several different purposes in clinical practice. Lynch syndrome or hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC) patients have up to an 80% lifetime incidence of colorectal cancer in addition to increased risk for endometrial, skin, urinary tract, ovarian, small intestinal, biliary and gastric cancers, among others. High microsatellite instability (MSI-H) characterizes >90% of colorectal carcinomas occurring in the setting of Lynch syndrome and serves as a surrogate marker of DNA mismatch repair deficiency. The DNA mismatch repair machinery is composed of a number of genes, with MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, and PMS2, as well as the recently identified EPCAM, accounting for about 95% of the identifiable causative mutations in Lynch syndrome. About 10-15% of sporadic colorectal carcinomas also demonstrate MSI-H phenotype. Both sporadic and HNPCCassociated MSI-H colorectal carcinomas can demonstrate defects in MLH1 expression by immunohistochemistry, whereas loss of expression of MSH2, MSH6 or isolated PMS2 are more commonly associated with Lynch syndrome/HNPCC than sporadic cancers. Melanoma BRAF mutations occur in 40-70% of cutaneous melanomas, with V600E mutations accounting for >90% of mutations. BRAF mutations seem to predict clinical response to either BRAF or MEK inhibitors in melanoma and other tumors. Vemurafenib (Zelboraf®) and dabrafenib (Tafinlar®) have been approved by the U.S. Food & Drug Administration for the treatment of inoperable or metastatic melanoma that is positive for the BRAF V600E mutation. Trametinilib (Mekinist®) is approved to treat patients whose tumors express the BRAF V600E or 600K gene mutations. Although BRAF V600E accounts for the vast majority of V600 mutations, other activating mutations have been reported. The most common of which is the BRAF V600K mutation, which, based on limited data, seems to have a response rate similar to V600E mutant melanomas after undergoing targeted therapy. Other mutations in codon 600 (e.g., V600M) may also respond to BRAF or MEK inhibitor therapy, but actual data are quite limited. Gene sequencing all carcinomas with MLH1 loss would be unnecessarily laborious and expensive, and BRAF mutation testing can help exclude about half of these patients. BRAF V600E mutations occur in up to 75% of sporadic MSI-H colorectal carcinomas, whereas, until recently, these mutations were never reported in HNPCC-associated carcinomas. There are rare reports of Lynch syndrome-associated mutations (1-2%; reported in PMS2, MLH1 and MSH2 mutation carriers) with concomitant BRAF V600E mutation, so the discovery of a BRAF mutation does not absolutely exclude Lynch syndrome (J Med Genet. 2012 Mar;49(3):151-7). 9500 Euclid Avenue | Cleveland, Ohio 44195 | 216.444.5755 | 800.628.6816 | clevelandcliniclabs.com Prognostic/predictive marker in metastatic colorectal carcinoma Several retrospective studies have found that tumors harboring BRAF V600E mutations do not respond to anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody therapy, similar to KRAS codon 12/13 mutations. Anti-EGFR therapies are extremely expensive, have side effects and may delay the use of other, more effective treatments in these patients. However, this predictive role of BRAF mutation recently has come under question following publication of the first prospective data examining BRAF mutation status and outcome. KRAS/BRAF wild type tumors had a significantly reduced risk of disease progression and significantly increased odds of response when treated with conventional chemotherapy and an anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody compared with those who received conventional chemotherapy alone. However, there was no difference in overall survival in these groups. Accordingly, the National Comprehensive Cancer Network views BRAF mutation testing in metastatic colorectal cancer as optional. BRAF V600E also has prognostic value in colorectal cancer. Patients with metastatic colorectal carcinoma or microsatellite stable (MSS) non-metastatic colorectal carcinoma harboring BRAF V600E mutations have been found to have significantly worse overall survival, progression-free survival and response rates to conventional chemotherapy. Thyroid carcinoma BRAF is the most commonly mutated gene in papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC), occurring in approximately 45% of tumors. Greater than 95% of BRAF mutations in PTC are the V600E transversion. BRAF mutations usually are encountered in PTC with conventional or tall cell histology, whereas BRAF mutation in the follicular variant of PTC is uncommon. BRAF mutations are not seen in follicular neoplasms, making BRAF mutations a good marker of PTC. In addition, BRAF V600E mutations have been correlated with aggressive histologic features in PTC, poor treatment outcomes, tumor recurrence and tumor-related death. Clinical Indications BRAF Codon 600 mutation testing is reflexively performed on all MSI-H colorectal neoplasms that demonstrate loss of MLH1 immunohistochemical protein expression. For the remaining numerous possible indications, the test is performed on a case-by-case basis. Interpretation Results are reported as “No BRAF mutation detected,” or “BRAF p.V600E (c.1799T>A) mutation detected.” If a mutation other than BRAF V600E is detected, the particular mutation will be reported in a similar manner to V600E. Results are confirmed using both forward and reverse sequences. Limitations of the Assay Tissue may be fresh-frozen or, most commonly, formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded. If paraffin-embedded, a pathologist will review a representative H&E-stained slide and select the most appropriate region for microdissection; microdissection is routinely performed to increase tumor DNA yield. The lower limit of reliable mutation detection is 25% tumor cells, and mutations may not be detected in samples with abundant dilution by non-tumor DNA. This is particularly relevant in the post-adjuvant therapy setting. Methodology BRAF mutation testing is performed by DNA sequencing on the ABI 3730 Genetic Analyzer. Following PCR amplification DNA with primers flanking codon 600 within exon 15, the purified PCR product is subjected to cycle sequencing using the BigDye® Terminator Cycle Sequencing Kit (Applied Biosystems, Carlsbad, Calif.). Forward and reverse strands are sequenced. Cycle sequencing products are purified using the BigDye XTerminator® Purification Kit (Applied Biosystems) and loaded on the ABI 3730 Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems). Sequences are aligned with wild type sequences and assessed for the V600E point mutation or any other mutations in the sequenced DNA. Suggested Reading 7. Tsai J, Lee JT, Wang W, et al.

The virus is spread from person to person and is most likely transmitted through the respiratory pathway. Although its prevalence is high — 60 to 90% of people have antibodies to the BK virus — the infection usually remains latent and individuals rarely demonstrate signs and symptoms. However, the virus is important in immunocompromised hosts, where reactivation of the latent infection causes disease. This virus has also emerged as an important cause of renal allograft infection (i.e. BK nephropathy). The BK virus also is associated with urethral stenosis, interstitial nephritis, and is one of the causes of hemorrhagic cystitis in bone marrow transplant recipients.1 The use of immunosuppressive drugs, which are necessary to prevent immunologic rejection of the renal allograft, has the side effect of increasing the likelihood of opportunistic infections. This immunosuppressed state affords the reactivation of a latent BK virus, and if viral replication remains unchecked, then BK nephropathy will develop. It is estimated reactivation of the BKV occurs in 10 to 60% of renal transplant recipients, with anywhere from 1 to 5% developing BK nephropathy.2,3 Screening and early intervention for BKV has been a major advance over the past six to seven years and has led to an approximately eight-fold reduction in graft loss due to BKV. Most kidney transplant centers now employ BKV screening using quantitative BKV tests. The presence of the BK virus may be assessed through a qualitative PCR of the urine. If the BK virus is present, then the quantity of the BK polyoma virus present is important. The higher the viral load in blood, the more likely the presence of renal disease. A progressive rise in serum creatinine concentration in a kidney transplant recipient, regardless of the underlying cause, should prompt a referral for reevaluation by the transplant center. Treatment of BK nephropathy remains poorly defined. Most often, a decrease in immunosuppression is the therapy of choice, but this must be carefully balanced with the increased risk of renal allograft rejection.4 Clinical Indications The BK virus most commonly produces asymptomatic infections. However, for patients with kidney and bone marrow transplants, BK virus infections are a cause of morbidity and mortality. Therefore, the quantitative BKV by PCR assay is indicated for renal transplant patients who are known to harbor the BK virus, particularly those with deterioration in renal function. The assay is only to be used in patients with appropriate risk factors for BK-associated disease, and is not indicated for screening of asymptomatic patients. International consensus guidelines have established the blood viral load of 10,000 copies/ml as a common threshold for intervention.5 In most patients, the quantity of the BK virus can be reduced with prompt restoration of BK virus-specific immunity, frequent monitoring, and timely modification or reduction of immunosuppression. According to an international consensus panel (Hirsch HH, 2005), monitoring for BK virus is recommended every three months for the first two years post-renal transplant or when allograft dysfunction occurs. Methodology Quantitative real-time PCR for the BK virus in the blood is currently the only noninvasive test for the measurement and monitoring of the BK viral load, which is important for the diagnosis and assessment of the treatment of BK nephropathy. 9500 Euclid Avenue | Cleveland, Ohio 44195 | 216.444.5755 | 800.628.6816 | clevelandcliniclabs.com Cleveland Clinic Laboratories Interpretation Results are reported in copies/mL of polyoma (BKV) virus.

Beryllium is a lightweight metal that can cause a chronic granulomatous in individuals who develop beryllium-specific, cell-mediated immunity. Testing for an individual’s sensitivity to beryllium is performed with an in vitro lymphocyte stimulation assay. This is used not only as a screening assay but also as a part of the diagnostic criteria for chronic beryllium disease. The blood lymphocyte proliferation test for beryllium sensitization (Be-LPT) is measured by H3-thymidine uptake in a cell culture system. H3-thymidine incorporation reveals the levels of lymphocyte stimulation in the presence of Beryllium SO4. The measurement of T-Cell activation is used clinically in the evaluation of immune competence, in the assessment of prior exposure to an antigen during hypersensitivity state, and in monitoring the relative activity of disease where T-cells play an important role. When an antigen-specific stimulus is employed, this assay can be used to demonstrate a sensitized state or to test current immunocompetence. Clinical Indications Beryllium is a lightweight metal with high melting point, high strength and good electrical conductivity. As a result, beryllium has become widely used in a variety of industrial applications, such as thermal coating, nuclear reactors, rocket heat shields, micro-circuits, brakes, X-ray tubes, golf clubs and dental plates. Frequently, it is formulated as an alloy or an oxide. It is estimated that approximately 800,000 U.S. workers have been exposed to beryllium, with the potential to develop beryllium sensitization or chronic beryllium disease (CBD).1 Correlation between the clinical status of CBD (chronic beryllium disease) and in vitro responses to beryllium in an LPT (lymphocyte proliferation test) was developed.2 An elevated blood Be-LPT response may indicate asymptomatic beryllium hypersensitivity of CBD (overt or sub-clinical). As a follow-up step, individuals may undergo pulmonary evaluation, including bronchoscopy, trans-bronchial biopsy, BAL and BAL Be-LPT. Interpretation The stimulation index (S.I.) for PHA should be ≥50.0 and the S.I. for Candida albicans should be ≥2.0 to indicate intact T-cell function. If all six beryllium indices are less than 3.0 this signifies a normal BESO4 result. Ratios of greater than 3.0 in two or more beryllium indices constitutes an abnormal response that is compatible with beryllium hypersensitivity. References 1.

Although the breakpoints in BCR and ABL are variable, in >95% of cases of CML, the translocation results in production of the p210 isoform of the fusion protein (e13a2 or e14a2 fusion genes). Modern therapy for CML, including tyrosine kinase inhibitors, has resulted in effective therapeutic options for CML patients. With this advance in treatment has come the need for effective monitoring for the presence of minimal residual disease (MRD) and the ability to recognize disease progression at an early stage. Techniques such as fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and metaphase cytogenetics provide valuable information at the time of initial diagnosis of CML and metaphase cytogenetics is helpful for identifying the emergence of additional chromosomal abnormalities, however, neither of these techniques are sufficiently sensitive to monitor MRD.1,2 For this reason, a BCR/ABL p210 quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) assay was developed, validated, and implemented in the Department of Molecular Pathology. To facilitate comparison of quantitative RT-PCR results between laboratories and platforms, International Scale reference materials were established by the World Health Organization.3 Results of this assay are now reported on the International Scale. Clinical Indications Quantitative detection of BCR/ABL p210 transcripts (e13a2 or e14a2) in patients with CML. Interpretation Results are reported as the percentage ratio of fusion gene transcripts to wild-type ABL transcripts (% BCRABL/ABL). Results are also converted to the International Scale. A BCRABL/ABL value of 0.1% on the International Scale represents a major molecular response by consensus criteria. Methodology Assay sensitivity was established using RNA extracted from K562 cultured cells suspended in normal buffy coat. This assay successfully detects p210 BCR/ABL transcripts in RNA extracted from one K562 cell in 100,000 peripheral blood leukocytes from a normal individual. References 1.

Apo A1 recycles cholesterol from the tissues back to the liver for further processing. Apo A1 is a cofactor for lecithincholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT), which is responsible for the formation of most plasma cholesteryl esters. Apo A-1 may also have an anti-clotting effect because it can stabilize prostacyclin. Defects in the gene encoding Apo A1 are associated with HDL deficiencies and systemic non-neuropathic amyloidosis. Decreases in concentration of Apo A1 in blood are associated with increased risk for coronary artery disease. However, other conditions such as severe malnutrition, uncontrolled diabetes, chronic renal failure and drugs (androgens, beta blockers, diuretics, etc.) may also cause decreasing concentrations of Apo A1. Recent scientific research showed that measurement of apolipoproteins may be better indicators of the total number of atherogenic particles versus measuring HDL, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL). Apo A1 along with Apo B is measured by using immune nephelometric method. The assays are performed on Beckman Coulter IMMAGE 800 Immunochemistry System. Antibody to human apolipoprotein is mixed with antigen in a sample. The increase in light scatter resulting from the antigen-antibody reaction is converted to a peak rate signal, which is a function of the concentration of antigen in the sample. Following calibration, the peak rate signal for a particular assay is automatically converted to concentration units by the analyzer. Clinical Indications Apo A1 may be measured when patients have a personal or family history of dyslipidemia (hyperlipidemia) and/or premature cardiac vascular diseases (CVD). If patients have recurrent CV events despite adequate risk factor treatment, or a strong family history of coronary heart disease, measurement of Apo A1 may help physicians to find and target the cause. Measurement of Apo A1 can be used to determine if patients have deficiency in Apo A1 causing dyslipidemia, and to monitor effectiveness from lipid-lowering treatment or lifestyle changes, such as decreased dietary fat and increased regular exercise. An Apo A1 assay may be ordered along with an Apolipoprotein B (Apo B) to determine an Apo A1/Apo B ratio, which is sometimes used as an alternative to a total cholesterol/HDL ratio to evaluate risk for developing cardiovascular disease.

Both primary and secondary forms of APAs exist, the difference being whether they arise spontaneously or in association with another condition. These antibodies — also known as lupus anticoagulants due to their prevalence in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus — are extremely heterogeneous and are directed against a wide variety of anionic phospholipids, including cardiolipin, ß2 glycoprotein 1 (B2GP1), cell-membrane phosphatidylserine, and many others. Paradoxically, APAs prolong clot-based assays in vitro while predisposing to thrombosis in vivo. In fact, approximately 30% of APA patients will experience thrombosis. A panel of assays is necessary to detect APAs as no single test presently available is sufficient. Diagnosis of APS is made by clinico-pathologic evaluation. In addition to clinical criteria such as vascular thrombosis or pregnancy morbidity, repeated laboratory testing of APA is required for the diagnosis because of transient low level increase of APA in many clinical conditions including infection. The laboratory criteria include positive testing for one of the following on 2 or more occasions, at least 12 weeks apart: 1. lupus anticoagulant; 2. anticardiolipin antibodies (IgG or IgM) in medium or high titer; 3. B2GP1 antibodies (IgG or IgM). Lupus anticoagulant (LA) testing: Based upon consensus criteria from the International Society for Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH), confirmation of a LA requires that the following criteria are met: • Performing two or more phospholipid-dependent clotting tests and demonstrating prolongation of at least one test (i.e. aPTT or dilute Russelll Viper Venom Test (dRVVT)) • Evidence for inhibitory activity shown by the effect of patient plasma on normal pooled plasma. (i.e. positive mixing study) • Demonstration of phospholipid-dependence of the inhibitor on a confirmatory test shown by shortening of the clotting time with the addition of more phospholipid. • Exclusion of a co-existing specific factor inhibitor, particularly factor VIII or an anticoagulant drug such as heparin or direct thrombin inhibitor (DTI). Anticardiolipin antibody (ACA) IgG, IgM or IgA, and B2GP1 antibody IgG or IgM testing: ACAs recognize a complex of cardiolipin, a naturally found phospholipid, bound to a protein called B2GP1. Complexes of anionic phospholipids and endogenous plasma proteins provide more than one epitope recognized by natural autoantibodies. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) is performed for APA testing. Because the antigen target of ACAs is B2GP1 bound to cardiolipin, B2GP1 antibodies are considered to be more specific than ACA assays. Clinical Indications for Testing Suspicion for APS in patients with an elevated aPTT, unexplained thrombocytopenia, or a history of arterial and venous thrombosis and/or obstetric complications. Interpretation Lupus Anticoagulant Tests for LA are interpreted as positive, indeterminate or negative. A narrative interpretation is issued for each patient panel. Positive: Panel of tests meets all four diagnostic criteria. If one screening test, one mixing test and one confirmatory test are positive and there is no evidence for a factor inhibitor or anticoagulant drug effect, the diagnostic criteria for LA are fulfilled. Indeterminate: Fewer than four diagnostic criteria are met. If clinical suspicion exists, the patient should be retested at a later date. Negative: None of four diagnostic criteria is met. Anticardiolipin Antibodies and B2GP1 Antibodies Tests for ACA and B2GP1 are interpreted as positive, equivocal or negative. Reference range of each test in the diagnostic panel is shown in Table 1. 9500 Euclid Avenue | Cleveland, Ohio 44195 | 216.444.5755 | 800.628.6816 | clevelandcliniclabs.com Methodology Laboratory testing for LA consists of a panel of assays (at least two assays on different principles in each criterion) specifically performed together to maximize diagnostic potential. See the LA Diagnostic Algorithm located on the back page. Test Category Tests Performed Screening Tests aPTT, aPTT screen, dRVVT screen, Hexagonal PL screen Mixing Studies Mixing Study aPTT (immediate and delayed), dRVVT mix PL Confirmatory Tests dRVVT confirm ratio, hexagonal PL confirm, platelet neutralization (PNP) Screening Tests: Four screening tests are performed: the standard laboratory automated aPTT, a more APA-sensitive manual aPTT screen reagent (which contains a different phospholipid composition), the dilute Russell’s viper venom test (dRVVT), a clot-based assay that uses snake venom to activate Factor X directly, and the hexagonal PL screen, which uses a very dilute aPTT reagent to increase sensitivity to phospholipids. Mixing Studies: Patient plasma and normal control plasma are mixed 1:1 and an aPTT and dRVVT test is performed on the mixed sample. In the presence of an inhibitor in the patient’s plasma, the normal plasma also is affected, and the clotting time will not correct into the normal range. However, if the initial prolonged clotting time was due to a factor deficiency in the patient’s plasma, the normal plasma corrects this deficiency and the resultant clotting time time will be normal. The aPTT mixing study also includes a onehour incubation step to check for more slow-acting specific factor inhibitors. PL Confirmatory Tests: Several tests are used to confirm the phospholipid-dependence of an inhibitor. • The dRVVT confirm ratio is performed by adding PL to plasma and repeating the dRVVT assay. The ratio is calculated by the dRVVT screen/dRVVT confirm. • The hexagonal phase phospholipid test (STAclot) confirm is performed by adding hexagonal PL to plasma and repeating the hexagonal PL screen. The Delta is calculated by the hexagonal PL screen — the hexagonal PL confirm • The platelet neutralization procedure (PNP) uses phospholipid-containing platelet membranes to neutralize the aPTT-prolonging effects of an LA. A PNP test is positive when the prolonged aPTT is shortened by the addition of platelet lysate. Exclusion Assays: The presence of other inhibitors must be excluded to confirm the presence of an APA. These include drugs (heparin, DTIs) and specific factor inhibitors (factor VIII is the most common). Tests for each of these are included in the panel, as required per the LA algorithm. Specific antibodies against cardiolipin and B2GP1 are measured by solid-phase ELISA assay. Limitations of the Assays LAs are heterogeneous in terms of antigenic recognition, and aPTT reagents are variable in terms of phospholipid composition. Thus, variability in detection of LAs may exist between individual reagents, between different panel tests, and/or between laboratories. Consequently, a normal aPTT cannot definitively exclude the presence of a LA; therefore, if clinical suspicion is high, the full panel may be performed. Both ACA and B2GP1 APA assays are recommended because using one B2GP1 antibody assay can miss some cases of APA. References 1. Pengo V, Tripodi A, Reber G, et al.

Most often amyloid deposits are identified in the heart, kidney and vascular walls, but virtually every organ system can be affected. All amyloid deposits are thought to be composed of proteins forming betapleated sheets, structures that render them insoluble and rigid. In histologic sections stained with hematoxylin-eosin, amyloid deposits can be difficult to differentiate from serum or dense collagen. Several stains have been developed to assist in the diagnosis of amyloid, with the Congo Red stain currently considered the gold standard. The microfibrillar nature of the amyloid deposits can be confidently identified by electron microscopy, while the beta-pleated sheet structure of the amyloid can only be demonstrated with x-ray diffraction, a technique exclusively used in research. Clinical Indications Investigations leading to the diagnosis of systemic amyloidosis can be triggered by a variety of symptoms induced by heart or kidney failure, neuropathy or coagulation abnormalities. Abnormalities suggestive of cardiac amyloidosis have been described by ultrasonography. Amyloid deposits can be identified during workups for low-grade lymphomas, plasma cell myelomas, familial conditions or renal failure. There are four major types of systemic amyloidosis: primary amyloidosis, familial amyloidosis, secondary amyloidosis and senile amyloidosis. The most common form of amyloidosis, primary amyloidosis, is the consequence of deposits of immunoglobulin light chains. Primary amyloidosis is usually diagnosed in patients with plasma cell neoplasms, from monoclonal gammopathy to plasma cell myeloma. Familial amyloidosis is a consequence of inherited mutations, most common in the transthyretin gene. Transthyretin, this time in its wild-type form, is the main component of amyloid in senile amyloidosis, a condition most often diagnosed in the heart. With the decrease in the incidence of chronic inflammatory diseases, mainly infectious, and with better management of autoimmune disorders, the incidence of secondary amyloidosis has markedly decreased and is currently a rare disease. The main amyloidogenic protein in secondary amyloidosis is Amyloid A. Overall, at least 28 proteins have been described to be responsible for the formation of amyloid deposits. In addition to the proteins that are considered amyloidogenic, amyloid deposits in all types of systemic amyloidosis constantly include other proteins: Serum P component (SAP), Apolipoprotein E (ApoE), Apolipoprotein A-I (ApoA-I) and Apolipoprotein A-IV (ApoA-IV). While from a purely morphologic point of view there are no significant differences between different types of amyloid, the treatment of each type of amyloidosis is different. Immunohistochemical stains show the amyloid deposits to be positive for SAP, but this does not always allow the differentiation of amyloid from serum. In many cases stains for Transthyretin, Amyloid A, kappa or lambda immunoglobulin light chains allow further characterization of the components of the amyloid deposits. However, in a significant number of cases these techniques fail to identify with confidence the amyloidogenic protein. Factors that prevent a confident diagnosis include abnormal protein folding and truncation, as well as the presence of many other endogenous proteins in the amyloid deposits. This results in a significant fraction of cases being inadequately typed and, as a consequence, treated. Recent studies have shown liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) to be a reliable method in the identification of amyloidogenic proteins and it is considered by some groups as the current gold standard. This technique was initially used on fresh or frozen tissue, but recently it has been shown that analysis of formalin- fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue (FFPET) can lead to similar results. The analysis usually begins with visual identification of amyloid deposits, followed by their dissection under the microscope (laser microdissection). The specimen is then digested with trypsin, resulting in the generation of peptide fragments. LC-MS/MS is then used to analyze these peptide fragments, resulting in an m/z spectrum. The specific m/z characteristics of the different peaks are compared to those in several databases, leading to the identification of the peptide fragments in the amyloid 9500 Euclid Avenue | Cleveland, Ohio 44195 | 216.444.5755 | 800.628.6816 | clevelandcliniclabs.com Cleveland Clinic Laboratories digested by trypsin. These peptide fragments are quantified and the higher the number of peptide fragments originating from a particular amyloidogenic protein, the higher the degree of confidence that the particular protein is a component of the amyloid. Peptides from the structures of SAP, Transthyretin, ApoE, ApoAI and ApoA-IV are used as internal controls, indicating the adequate identification of amyloid. When more than one amyloidogenic protein is identified, comparison of the relative abundance of peptide fragments can indicate which protein is the most abundant in the sample. spectrometry, as this method has not been developed as a substitute for a detailed morphologic analysis, Congo Red stain or immunohistochemistry. Amyloid analysis by tandemmass spectometry requires that a sufficient amount of amyloid is microdissected. In a few cases the assay may fail due to the insufficient amyloid available. In some cases additional immunohistochemical stains are necessary in order to increase the confidence with which the diagnosis is rendered. This amyloid typing test allows typing of the amyloid deposits with a precision superior to the other available techniques. It incorporates multiple internal controls and allows amyloid typing to be performed in archived specimens. When necessary, in addition to the LC-MS/MS, alternative techniques such as immunohistochemical stains can be employed. Sipe JD, Benson MD, Buxbaum JN, et al.

AATD predisposes an individual to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), liver disease, panniculitis and C-ANCA-positive vasculitis. AATD is caused by pathogenic mutations in SERPINA1 (RefSeq NM_000295), the gene that encodes alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT). Alpha-1 antitrypsin is an inhibitor of neutrophil elastase. Excess neutrophil elastase can destroy the alveolar walls of the lung, causing emphysema. Mutations in SERPINA1 can also cause accumulation of abnormal proteins in hepatocytes leading to chronic liver disease. AATD is inherited as an autosomal co-dominant condition and more than 120 variants in SERPINA1 have been described. Alleles in AATD are named with the prefix PI* for “protease inhibitor.” The PI*M allele is present in approximately 95% of unaffected individuals. The majority of patients with AATD have the PI*S and PI*Z alleles. The PI*S allele causes a functionally deficient form of SERPINA1, but has a relatively mild phenotype, unless combined with other pathogenic alleles. The PI*Z allele also encodes a functionally deficient form of alpha-1 antitrypsin, but may express as a more severe phenotype, with lung and liver involvement. Approximately 95% of individuals with clinical manifestations of AATD have the PI*ZZ genotype. Serum alpha-1 antitrypsin levels correlate with the AAT phenotype as shown in Table 1. Other rare variants of SERPINA1 exist and can also cause lung and liver disease. Null, deficient and dysfunctional forms of alpha-1 antitrypsin occur, but are much less common than the PI*S and PI*Z alleles. Targeted testing for the PI*M, PI*S, and PI*Z alleles will identify the majority of pathogenic mutations. However, if a discordant serum alpha-1 antitrypsin level and phenotype is identified, additional testing by either isoelectric focusing or Sanger sequencing is recommended to better characterize the SERPINA1 variant. Clinical Indications Diagnostic Testing According to available guidelines, diagnostic testing is recommended for symptomatic adults with emphysema, COPD or asthma that is incompletely responsive to bronchodilators, individuals with unexplained liver disease, asymptomatic individuals with persistent obstruction on pulmonary function tests with identifiable risk factors, adults with necrotizing panniculitis and siblings of adults with AATD. It is acceptable to test adults with bronchiectasis without clear risk factors for bronchiectasis, adolescents with persistent airflow obstruction, asymptomatic individuals with persistent obstruction on pulmonary function tests with no identifiable risk factors, adults with C-ANCA-positive vascultitis and other conditions enumerated in Table 2.

Methodology Targeted variant analysis is performed using real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with fluorescent labeled TaqmanR probes for allelic discrimination assay (Applied Biosystems) to identify only the specified alleles of SERPINA1, PI*M, PI*S and PI*Z. Genomic DNA is isolated from the peripheral blood and a two-step PCR protocol using specific, fluorescent, dye-labeled probes is performed to differentiate between the three alleles. Fluorescence signals generated by the PCR amplification indicate which alleles are present in the patient’s sample. Interpretation This assay will not detect other mutations that may cause AATD. Uncommon variants or SNPs may affect binding of TaqmanR probes and may result in a false negative or false positive result. Results of this assay do not completely guarantee that the patient has no other SERPINA1 variants. Correlation of the genotype with the patient’s serum alpha-1 antitrypsin level as well as clinical manifestation is strongly recommended. When discrepancies exist between the enzyme level and targeted genotype results, sequencing of the coding regions of the SERPINA1 gene can be performed to identify rare mutations. Table 3.

(ususally Candida albicans), the parasite Trichomonas vaginalis, and/or the syndrome bacterial vaginosis (BV). Infectious vaginitis is one of the most common women’s health problems in the US, resulting in health care costs of more than $500 million annually.4 Approximately 40 to 45 percent of the infections are caused by bacterial vaginosis, about 25 percent by Candida, and another 20 percent by Trichomonas vaginalis.4 Diagnosis of these entities has historically been done by examination of wet mount and/or stained preparations of the vaginal discharge in the physician’s office or clinical laboratory. However, recent studies suggest the sensitivity of these traditional methods is low and up to 14 percent or more of infectious vaginitis may be a mixed infection.2 A study evaluating the usual methods of direct examination of the discharge for the diagnosis of vaginitis was conducted among a cohort of 220 women presenting with vaginal complaints. Results indicated that two thirds of the cases of Candida and BV were misdiagnosed by general practitioners and gynecologists.10 Both trichomoniasis and bacterial vaginosis have been linked with other sequelae apart from the asymptomatic or symptomatic vaginitis they cause. This includes enhanced HIV transmission, increased pelvic inflammatory disease, tubal infertility and possible associations with preterm birth and prematurity.11 Therefore, appropriate diagnosis of BV and its etiology is important. Clinical Information Vaginitis, the presence of a vaginal discharge, can be due to infection or non-infectious conditions. The latter includes allergic vaginitis or chemical vaginitis. The etiology of infectious vaginitis can be one or more of the following: Candida albicans, Trichomonas vaginalis or the syndrome bacterial vaginosis (BV). Treatment of infectious vaginitis depends on the etiology; if more than one entity is responsible, treatment for both should be given. Yeast vaginitis (candidiasis) often presents with a white vaginal discharge with a “cottage cheese” consistency. The wet mount examination for detecting budding yeast cells has a sensitivity of < 60%; culture for Candida sp. is a more sensitive method and usually considered to be the gold standard for diagnosis, but it is more timeconsuming. Trichomonas vaginalis usually presents with a frothy, sometimes green-tinged discharge that has an acidic pH; the usual wet mount for the detection of Trichomonas vaginalis can be a sensitive and specific method, provided the examination is performed immediately after the discharge has been collected and is read by experienced personnel. However, when vaginal specimens are transported to clinical laboratories, often the parasite is non-viable by the time wet mounts are prepared and read, reducing the ability of the observer to detect it, hence considerably reducing the sensitivity of detection. Even a 10-minute delay may reduce the sensitivity to 20%.5 Culture for Trichomonas vaginalis is > 95% sensitive, however it requires a specialized medium and incubation up to two to three days.4 Many clinical laboratories do not offer Trichomonas cultures. BV usually presents with a thin homogeneous, malodorous discharge. BV is a syndrome, not a monomicrobic disease, resulting from a disturbance of the usual vaginal flora. When disease occurs, there is a decrease in the usual predominance of gram positive Lactobacillus sp. and an increase or predominance in gram negative bacteria including Gardnerella vaginalis, Mobiluncus, spp. and Atopobium spp., among others.3 Many females carry Gardnerella routinely as part of the vaginal flora and its mere presence in culture does not signify the syndrome. Culture would hence be quite sensitive, but not specific and should not be used for the 9500 Euclid Avenue | Cleveland, Ohio 44195 | 216.444.5755 | 800.628.6816 | clevelandcliniclabs.com diagnosis of BV. Culture of the other involved organisms that could be responsible is very time-consuming and methods are not routinely available. The traditional physician’s office method of detection is to look for “clue cells” on a wet mount preparation, in conjunction with determination of the pH (should be higher than 4.5 in BV) of the discharge and appearance of a fishy amine odor after application of 40% KOH. These clue cells are vaginal squamous epithelial cells covered with coccobacilli and curved rods in place of the usual gram positive Lactobacillus sp. The borders of these epithelial cells are studded with bacteria and the margins of the epithelial cells are masked. Although a long-used method for diagnosis, the detection of clue cells via wet mount has been shown to lack sensitivity and specificity, although the latter can be increased if > 20% of the epithelial cells are classified as clue cells.9 The scored Gram stain has become the more standardized and sensitive method for detection of BV. In this test, the vaginal discharge is Gram stained and read for the presence and quantity of Lactobacillus, gram variable bacilli, gram negative bacilli, and curved gram negative bacilli. The more Lactobacillus, the lesser the score; the less Lactobacillus and greater numbers of gram variable and gram negative bacilli, the more likely the interpretation will be BV. Although shown to have a very good correlation with the clinically recognized Amsel criteria for diagnosis of BV, the scored Gram stain can lack reproducibility among readers.1,8,9 The Affirm VPIII probe utilizes a nucleic acid probe to detect the pathogens associated with infectious vaginitis. It can detect 104 CFU/mL Candida cells; 10 Trichomonas vaginalis and > 105 CFU Gardnerella vaginalis (GV) (numbers higher than GV carriage). Studies have shown that use of the probe can increase sensitivity over wet mounts for Trichomonas vaginalis (TV) and BV, and is equivalent to culture of Candida spp., for example.1a In a recent study comparing the Affirm VPIII vs PAP smears for detection of agents of infectious vaginitis, 42.5% of 431 cases were positive for BV vs. 13.9% with PAP; 16.2% positive for Candida sp. vs 13.9% with PAP; 2.3% were positive on AFFIRM for TV vs 0.7% with PAP. Coinfection, predominantly with GV and Candida spp. were noted in 30 cases by Affirm and one case had all three organisms. Coinfection was seen with PAP in five cases only.6 In a study by Lowe et al, the accuracy of detection of BV, TV and Candida clinically was compared to the Affirm probe. Sensitivity of detection was 81-85% and specificity 70-99%7; using the Affirm VPIII for diagnosing Candida spp., Petrikkos et al reported a sensitivity of 82% and specificity of 100% when compared to the KOH examination.8a Interpretation The Affirm method detects Candida species, Trichomonas vaginalis, and Gardnerella vaginalis nucleic acid in vaginal fluid specimens. A negative results indicates <1x104 CFU Candida cells, <2 x 105 CFU G. vaginalis, and < 5 x 103 trichomonads. All test results require correlation with clinical signs and symptoms. The cause of bacterial vaginosis (BV) is not fully understood, but the condition is associated with a reduction in normal Lactobacillus flora and an increase in other bacteria including Gardnerella vaginalis, Mobiluncus, and Bacteroides. This test detects >2 x 105 CFU G. vaginalis and a positive result is suggestive, but not diagnostic for BV; results should be interpreted in conjunction with other data such as pH, amine odor, clue cells, and vaginal discharge characteristics. Limitations of the Assay Samples that are > 72 hours in transit to the laboratory from the time of collection will be rejected. Samples sent in other than the AFFIRM VPIII transport tube will not be processed. Samples should only be collected in patients who have clinical symptoms of vaginitis and/or a clinical diagnosis is made during examination by the physician. False positives can occur if the predictive value of the disease is low of the samples submitted. False negatives can occur with AFFIRM in cases where the organism is in lower numbers than the threshold of the probe, ie < 104 CFU Candida or < 103 Trichomonas vaginalis. 3.

The Affirm probe (Becton Dickinson Microbiology Systems, Sparks, MD) is a rapid test for the detection of the nucleic acid (RNA) of Candida albicans, Trichomonas vaginalis and Gardnerella vaginalis (as a marker for bacterial vaginosis). Vaginal discharge should be collected on a special swab (AFFIRM) from the posterior fornix and side walls of the vagina and submitted to the laboratory via a specific transport tube. The nucleic acid in the transport tube is stable for up to 72 hours at room temperature before processing. After a lysing reagent is added to each specimen, samples are placed into the AFFIRM instrument, a series of additions of a capture and detector probe occurs, and results are read on a Probe analysis card for each pathogen. The same cards contain a positive and negative control and results can be available within hours of collection of the samples. 6. Levi AW, Harigopal M, Hui P, Schofield K, Chhieng DC. 2011.

Reduced or absent ADAMTS13 activity can retain UL VWF that can trigger intravascular platelet aggregation and microthrombi caused by genetic mutations within the ADAMTS13 gene producing non-functional ADAMTS13 protein. These patients will have severely deficient ADAMTS13 activity with high risk for recurrent episodes of TTP, and usually do not develop autoantibodies to ADAMTS13.

Mildly decreased ADAMTS13 activity (30-67%) is often observed in TTP patients secondary to other clinical conditions, and unlikely related to idiopathic (autoimmunerelated) TTP. However, if there is a strong clinical suspicion of TTP, inhibitor assay can be performed. Methodology ADAMTS13 activity is measured by change of fluorescence using FRET technology with recombinant VWF86 substrate (American Diagnostica Inc/Sekisui, Stamford, CT) in citrated plasma. The basic principal of the method is that proteolytic cleavage of the VWF86-ALEXA FRET substrate between the Tyr-Met residues by ADAMTS13 uncouples the ALEXA fluorochromes resulting in an increase in fluorescence. ADAMTS13 inhibitor assay is measured by using a mixing study. After the patient’s plasma is mixed with normal pooled the diagnosis of TTP because of false normalization of ADAMTS13 activity.

It has a very poor prognosis with a median overall survival of only 12 to 15 months. Current treatments of GBM include surgical resection, radiotherapy, and administration of alkylating agents such as temozolomide (1). Alkylating agents inhibit DNA replication and induce tumor cell apoptosis by producing cross-links between adjacent DNA strands. The most common site for alkylation is the O6 position of guanine (2). Methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT), a DNA repair enzyme, specifically removes promutagenic alkyl groups from the O6 position of guanine in DNA. Repair of O6-alkylguanine adducts in tumor DNA reduces the cytotoxicity of alkylating chemotherapeutic agents, resulting in tumor chemoresistance (3). Preclinical and clinical evidence showed that the expression of MGMT is regulated primarily at the epigenetic level by promoter methylation (4). Under normal circumstances, the CpG sites spanning a large portion of the promoter and exon 1 of the MGMT gene are unmethylated. In some tumor cells, however, the cytosines at certain CpG sites are methylated. This prevents transcriptional factors from binding and eventually leads to On the Cover: Director of PLMI’s Cancer Epigenetics Core Laboratory Bin Yang, MD, PhD, (center) Kelly Lyon, laboratory manager, Molecular Pathology, (l) and Maureen Jakubowski, medical technologist (r) are the first to validate pyrosequencing on FFPE tissue for identifying MGMT methylation status in glioblastoma patients. MGMT status provides valuable molecular-based guidance for treatment planning for these patients. 2 the reduced expression of MGMT protein, which sensitizes the cancer cells to alkylating agents. Many studies have established a significant correlation between methylation of MGMT and a positive clinical outcome for patients with glioblastoma treated with alkylating agents such as temozolomide, carmustine, and procarbazine with or without radiotherapy (2, 5-7). Additionally, significant differences were demonstrated among varying levels of methylation, with a higher MGMT methylation level associated with longer overall survival (8). These studies suggested that MGMT methylation can predict glioblastoma chemosensitivity to alkylating agents and help determine the patient population likely to benefit from such treatment. Several methods have been used to identify MGMT methylation status (3, 9-12). Methylation-specific PCR (MSP) has high sensitivity and is widely used for assessing MGMT methylation in the research setting, but it is a qualitative technique with a high rate of false positives. The application of MSP in the clinical setting is limited by its mediocre compatibility with formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue specimens and requirement for high quality DNA (11). Pyrosequencing is a highly reproducible and quantitative method for confirming methylation status and has been shown to be the best approach for assessing MGMT methylation status in GBM patients and correlating with clinical outcomes (3). However, no studies have been done to validate this method in the clinical setting for its compatibility with FFPE tissue specimens, analytical quality, and clinical feasibility. In this study, we aimed to validate a quantitative MGMT methylation assay using pyrosequencing on FFPE GBM tissue to determine its analytical sensitivity and precision and clinical feasibility for pathologic diagnosis and prediction of glioblastoma chemosensitivity.

Tissue specimens came from 10 patients with epilepsy as non-neoplastic controls, 17 patients with resected GBM, and 16 patients with stereotaxic biopsy for GBM. All specimens were FFPE tissue transported and stored at room temperature. We first extracted genomic DNA from a 10 µm tissue section of FFPE tissue samples using the Gentra Puregene tissue kit (QIAGEN Inc., Valencia, Calif.). After extraction, we further purified the DNA using the QIAamp MiniElute column (QIAGEN Inc.) and performed the procedure for genomic DNA cleanup as given in the manufacturer’s manual. Approximately 100-200 ng DNA was subjected to bisulfite conversion using the EZ DNA Methylation Gold kit (Zymo Research, Orange, Calif.) according to the manufacture’s protocol. In this step, sodium bisulfite converts unmethylated cytosine to uracil, while methylated cytosine remains unchanged before PCR. A total of 10-20 ng bisulfite-treated DNA was carried on for PCR using the PyroMark PCR Kit (QIAGEN Inc.). PCR conditions for the MGMT gene were 95°C for 15 minutes; 45 cycles of 95°C for 20 seconds, 53°C for 20 seconds, and 72°C for 20 seconds; 72°C for five minutes, and then on hold at 4°C. The PCR products were immobilized to beads and strand separation. We then conducted the pyrosequencing methylation assay using the sequencing primer provided in the PyroMark CpG MGMT Kit on the PyroMark Q96 ID pyrosequencer (QIAGEN Inc.) The Pyromark CpG MGMT kit detected the level of methylation on 5 CpG sites located in exon 1 of the MGMT gene. A cytosine not followed by a guanine served as an internal control for completion of bisulfite conversion. The percent methylation (percent of Cs present) was reported for each CpG site. A sample with methylation above 10% was interpreted as positive. A sample below 10% methylation was interpreted as negative. We determined the analytical sensitivity of this methylation test by pyrosequencing using a series of DNA dilution tests. In these tests, SW40, a colon cancer cell line with a mean MGMT methylation of 95%, was used as the positive control; MRC5, a fibroblast cell line with 0% MGMT methylation, was used as the negative control. We diluted SW40 DNA with MRC5 DNA from a ratio of 1:10 to 1:1000. The most diluted concentration with detectable methylation was recorded as the analytical sensitivity, which was compared with the standard MSP method. In addition, we tested 50, 100, 150, and 200 ng DNA obtained from FFPE tissues in MGMT methylation pyrosequencing for the minimal requirement of DNA volume. To measure the biopsy specimen size needed for MGMT methylation pyrosequencing, we reviewed 50 consecutive GBM biopsy specimens in 2010 at our institution and documented the size of these specimens. We chose 16 biopsy specimens that represent the biopsy size below 30th percentile for testing. Genomic DNA was extracted from eight sections of 15 µm-thick FFPE blocks. The concentration of DNA was measured in duplicate in each case. Statistical analysis for this study was descriptive in nature. All the statistical analyses were performed using Stata 12 (StataCorp LP, College Station, Texas). Results We optimized the experimental conditions for the MGMT methylation pyrosequencing assay. After extraction, genomic DNA was further purified to generate highly purified DNA for pyrosequencing. The amount of DNA sample loss was less than 15%. We used the EZ DNA Methylation Gold kit for bisulfite conversion, which converts greater than 95% of unmethylated cytosines in the genome to satisfy the requirement of the PyroMark Q96 ID pyrosequencer for consistency. We determined the level of methylation on five CpG sites in exon 1 of the MGMT gene from the brain tissues of controls and patients with glioblastoma. Typical examples of pyrograms are shown in Figure 1. Shaded boxes encompass T/C pairs with methylation of five CpG sites measured quantitatively. In a typical tissue specimen from an epilepsy patient, most of the CpG sites are unmethylated with occasional sites exhibiting less than 10% methylation. In contrast, a typical tumor specimen from a glioma patient often has more than 25% methylation in all the CpG sites. 3 Pathology Innovations | Clinical | Translational Discussion A3: T/CGTTTTGT/CGTTTT/CGAT/CGTTT/CGTAGG 0% 0% 0% 4% 0% Results from several studies demonstrate that pyrosequencing is the preferred approach to stratify patients treated with temozolomide into different prognostic groups based on their measured MGMT methylation status. 75 50 25 0 E S A T C A G 5 T T G T C A G 10 T C T G A 15 T C A G 20 T C A G 25 T C G A Figure 2 As shown in Figure 2, we measured MGMT gene methylation in 10 non-neoplastic epilepsy patients. None of the epilepsy brain tissues exhibited more than 10% MGMT methylation. We observed a low level of MGMT methylation in two cases (4% and 8%). In contrast, among the glioblastoma tissues from 33 patients, the range of methylation percentage of any CpG island in the MGMT gene was between 33 and 95% with a mean of 65%. We observed greater than 10% MGMT methylation in 33% of patients (11/33) and greater than 5% MGMT methylation in 46% patients (15/33). We determined that 10% methylation is the cutoff to distinguish MGMT methylation-positive cases from negative cases. By a series dilution of a methylated cancer cell line with an unmethylated normal cell line, pyrosequencing can detect one tumor cell harboring MGMT methylation out of 80 to 100 cells without MGMT methylation. Pyrosequencing has a comparable sensitivity to MSP with fewer false-positive cases and provides the quantitative methylation value of each CpG island. We determined that 100 ng (approximately 3,000 cells) is the minimum amount of genomic DNA required for successful detection of MGMT methylation by pyrosequencing. Most of the clinical GBM biopsy specimens ranged from 0.1 to 3.0 cm in size with a median of 1.0 cm. We chose the 30% smallest biopsy tissues for testing. As shown in Figure 3, the mean DNA yield increase correlated with the increase in biopsy sample size. Four 15 µm-thick tissue sections should yield more than 300 ng genomic DNA, corresponding to a 0.3 cm biopsy specimen with less than 15%. To fulfill the clinical requirement of duplicate tests, 150 ng DNA samples could be used for each run. After the testing protocol was finalized, we ran a precision test with a known MGMT methylation case along with positive and negative controls. Results of duplicated tests were consistent and compatible with expected results. 4 The reliability and reproducibility of most of the previously developed methods such as MSP require high-quality DNA, often from a fresh frozen specimen (7). In most clinical settings, FFPE specimens are needed for easy transport and storage, but MSP can provide reliable MGMT methylation status on only two-thirds of FFPE tumor specimens (7). We solved this problem by further purifying the genomic DNA extract from FFPE tissue samples using a Qiagen MiniElute column. After elution with 100 µl AE buffer, we were able to generate highly purified genomic DNA for the subsequent steps with less than 15% DNA loss. Bisulfite conversion of cytosine is a crucial step toward success. Complete conversion of unmethylated cytosine to uracil is the basis of methylation quantification. Incomplete conversion leads to overestimation of MGMT methylation and severely compromises methods used on clinical samples with low DNA content. In our study, we compared two bisulfite treatment methods: the EZ DNA Methylation Gold kit and the Qiagen DNA methylation kit. The former method converts greater than 95% of unmethylated cytosines in the genome, which satisfies the requirement of the PyroMark Q96 ID pyrosequencer for consistent results. However, the latter method used in some of the previous studies converts only about 90% of unmethylated cytosines, which does not fulfill this requirement. The cutoff of 10% methylation that we chose to stratify patients was based on the maximum level of methylation (8%) in the control group. The 10% cutoff and the prevalence of MGMT hypermethylation in the tumor tissue of glioblastoma patients who met this criterion were consistent with previous reports (4, 11). The analytical sensitivity of our method for MGMT methylation detection ranges from 1:80 to 1:100, approximately five times less than MSP (1:500). Although MSP is more sensitive than pyrosequencing, has a false-positive rate of approximately 10% (10). This concern with false-positivity using MSP was mentioned in the literature due to its “super-sensitivity” and mispriming (PCR bias), which can be further aggravated by high cycle number and nested primers used for decreased Summer | 2012 sample quality of PPFE specimen (13). Since most testing samples will be GBM material from FNAB and are less diluted with normal brain tissue, sensitivity of 1:80-1:100 should be adequate for clinical usage. 3.

J Neurooncol. 2010;97(3):311-22. Further analysis in this study demonstrated agreement in 95% of cases between pyrosequencing and MSP assays. Pyrosequencing has higher specificity and provides a quantitative value of both average and individual CpG island methylation status, which may have higher predictive value for clinical outcomes (11). In contrast, MSP is not quantitative and cannot tell methylation status of individual CpG islands. 4. Esteller M, Herman JG. Generating mutations but providing chemosensitivity: the role of O6-methylguanine DNA methyltransferase in human cancer. Oncogene. 2004;23(1):1-8. In our study, 100 ng DNA is adequate to repeatedly detect MGMT methylation by pyrosequencing, which is much less than the Qiagen kit’s recommended more than 300 ng genomic DNA for research purposes. The biopsy sample size requirement (0.3 cm) of our method is considerably smaller than the current median sample size of 1.0 cm. DNA yielded from even the smallest GBM biopsy size (0.1 cm) at our institution in 2010 was enough for duplicated assays, demonstrating that our tissue requirement is reasonable clinically and is significantly less demanding than commercially available MSP kits that requires more than 1.0 cm tissue with minimal 500 ng input. To complete our technique, we created positive and negative report templates compatible with CAP MP reporting guidelines. Conclusion We described the first validated pyrosequencing-based MGMT methylation test on clinical FFPE biopsy tissue from 33 patients with glioblastoma and 10 patients with epilepsy as controls. We demonstrated that pyrosequencing detection of MGMT methylation has an analytical sensitivity and DNA and biopsy tissue requirements that are suitable for routine clinical application. The MGMT methylation assay provides pathologic diagnosis and a useful molecular biomarker for prediction of chemosensitivity in GBM patients. References 1. Wen PY, Kesari S.

Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death in men and women worldwide. Approximately 85% of all lung cancers are of non-small cell type. Advances in surgical treatment and combination therapies have improved the average one-year survival rate (38% for stage IA-IIB, Source: National Cancer Institute Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database) only marginally from the period 1975-1979 to the present; the five-year survival rate for all stages of lung cancer combined remains at 15%. The primary reason is that nearly 85% of cases present at an advanced stage. Targeting ALK Gene Rearrangements Crizotinib is highly effective in treating patients whose NSCLC tumors harbor a rearrangement of the anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) gene. The ALK-FISH assay allows for selection of the subgroup of NSCLC patients who are potentially therapyresponsive based on identification of ALK rearrangements at NSCLC ALK Testing: FISH 2p23 Region ALK rearrangements are typically mutually exclusive from EGFR and KRAS mutations, and the majority are found in adenocarcinomas. Patients with tumors exhibiting ALK rearrangements are usually younger, male and light or never-smokers. Lung adenocarcinomas with ALK rearrangement occur in 15% of this population with advanced stage NCSLC. ALK+ Response to Crizotinib ALK FISH is a qualitative fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) test that detects ALK gene rearrangements with all ALK Testing: FISH Centromere ALK 3’ ~300 kb The ALK gene encodes for a transmembrane glycoprotein with tyrosine kinase activity that normally is expressed only in select neuronal cell types. The constitutive kinase activity of ALK is essential for cellular proliferation in this subset of NSCLC. Gene rearrangements in the presence of known fusion partners, including EML4, TFG and KIF5B, result in a chimeric protein with tyrosine kinase activity. In particular the EML4/ALK fusion appears to be a key driver of tumorigenesis in NSCLC. The EML4/ALK fusion also has been identified in about 2.5% of breast and colon carcinomas using exonic sequencing. SHGC-104192 SHGC-56576 Telomere the 2p23 chromosome in the tumor genome. This genetic alteration occurs in 2 to 7% of NSCLC patients. 5’ ~442 kb LSI ALK Dual Color, Breakapart Rearrangement Probe Figure 1 Probe map, breakapart format probe set, FDA-approved fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) assay for identification of rearrangements at the 2p13 locus that includes the ALK gene. 6 Figure 2 Diagram of typical monoallelic ALK rearrangement.

Patient Selection Using ALK FISH The AMV ALK Break Apart FISH Probe mixture consists of two fluorophore-labeled DNA probes in hybridization buffer containing dextran sulfate, formamide, and SSC with blocking DNA. The two probes used are Vysis LSI 3 ′-ALK SpectrumOrange and LSI 5 ′-ALK SpectrumGreen. Figure 3 An atypical 2p23 ALK rearrangement (one green/red fusion signal + an isolated red signal). This pattern is also considered a positive result qualifying NSCLC patients for crizotinib-based therapy. potential fusion partners, including EML4, TFG and KIF5B. It is the only diagnostic assay approved by the U.S. Food & Drug Administration for in vitro diagnostic (IVD) use to predict response to crizotinib. Other available molecular testing methodologies such as RT-PCR detect only the fusion target for which they have been constructed (e.g. EML4/ALK fusion product), and, of course, other potentially clinically significant fusion targets will not be detected. The Abbott Molecular Vysis (AMV) ALK FISH kit was used in one of the two single-arm trials (Study A) leading to the FDA approval of crizotinib and has become the gold standard for detecting ALK rearrangement in NSCLC. Study A included 136 patients; Study B, 119 patients. All patients had locally advanced or metastatic ALK-positive NSCLC. Patients in both studies received 250 mg. crizotinib orally twice daily. The combined median age for both trials was 52 years; 63% of patients were Caucasian; 30% were Asian; 48% were male; 84% percent had an ECOG performance status of 0 or 1. Fewer than 3% of patients were current smokers. Ninety-six percent had adenocarcinoma, 95% had metastatic disease, and 9% had received prior systemic treatment for NSCLC. The primary endpoint of both trials was objective response rate (ORR) as assessed by the investigator. In Study A, the ORR was 50% (95% CI: 42%t, 59%) with a median response duration of 42 weeks. In Study B, the ORR was 61% (95% CI: 52%, 70%) with a median response duration of 48 weeks. A complete response was observed in 1% of patients. Per- The FDA-approved version of the test is performed on a formalinfixed paraffin-embedded NSCLC tissue specimen. Alternative approaches using cytopathology ThinPrep slides for probe hybridization with morphologic correlation are under active development. Following appropriate specimen preparation, the specimen is hybridized using the probe mixture described above at 37°C for 14 to 24 hours. After washing and counterstaining, slides are evaluated for adequate hybridization. Slides are then assessed for the quality of the ALK signal and the tissue morphology. Signals from 50 tumor cells from representative areas of the slide are recorded. When hybridized with the ALK FISH probes, the 2p23 ALK region in its native state will be observed as two immediately adjacent or fused (overlapping) orange/green (yellow) signals. However, if a chromosome rearrangement at the 2p23 ALK breakpoint region has occurred, one orange and one green signal separated by at least two signal diameters will be identified. Alternatively, a single orange signal (deletion of green signal) in addition to a fused or broken apart signal may be observed. Cells are considered negative (non-rearranged) when orange and green signals are adjacent or fused (appear yellow under the Orange/Green V2 filter). A single green signal without a corresponding orange signal is also abnormal, but represents a rearrangement at the 2p23 locus that is not predictive of over-expressed ALK protein. Orange and green signals that are less than two signal diameters apart are classified as a single fused signal. Cells are considered positive for a rearrangement when at least one set of orange and green signals are two or more signal diameters apart, or a single orange signal occurs without a corresponding green signal in addition to fused and/or broken apart signals. Multiple 2p23 signals are often observed as well, indicative of either genomic gain at 2p23 or an aneusomic state for chromosome 2. 7 Pathology Innovations | Clinical | Translational Figure 4 ALK overexpression in NSCLC tumor cell cytoplasm detected by immunohistochemistry. D5F3 primary antibody (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, Mass.) with detection via OptiView (Ventana Medical Systems, Tucson, Ariz.). A sample is considered negative if < 5 cells out of 50 (< 5/50 or < 10%) are positive. A sample is considered positive if > 25 cells out of 50 (> 25/50 or > 50%) are positive. A sample is considered equivocal if 5 to 25 cells (10 - 50%) are positive. If the sample is equivocal, a second technologist is required to evaluate the slide. The first and second cell count readings are added together, and a percent is calculated of 100 cells, the average percent positive cells. If the average percent positive cells is < 15% (< 15/100), the sample is considered negative. If the average percent positive cells is ≥ 15% (≥ 15/100), the sample is considered positive. ALK FISH demonstrates consistency of results across all readers with an overall percent agreement of 97.64 (95% CI: 96.25, 98.52). The positive percent agreement is 96.46 (95% CI: 94.40, 97.78), and the negative percent agreement is 100.00 (95% CI: 98.42, 100.00). Patients who are ALK positive are candidates for crizotinib therapy. For patients who are responsive to treatment, crizotinib yields significant clinical benefits. However, not all ALK-positive patients will respond, and those who do will eventually develop resistance to crizotinib. Time to drug resistance is unknown as yet; a variety of underlying molecular mechanisms are responsible for development of resistance The National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN Guidelines™) recognizes FISH as a specifically designed method for diagnosing ALK-rearranged adenocarcinomas. These guidelines recommend ALK testing concurrent with EGFR mutation testing in the diagnosis of adenocarcinoma, large cell, and other nonspecified histologic subsets of NSCLC. Investigation into the role of IHC staining with monoclonal antibodies specific for ALK protein in identifying patients with ALK rearrangements continues. IHC can be performed on small biopsies, may be less sensitive to variations in fixation conditions than FISH and can be performed in routine daily practice. 8 Figure 5 Absence of ALK overexpression in a NSCLC. Anthracotic pigment is present (lower right), but the tumor cells are negative. Depending on the monoclonal antibody and concentration used in IHC, overall sensitivity of IHC for ALK rearrangements ranges from 80 to 95% with specificity of 100%. A testing algorithm using IHC as an initial screening in all cases of NSCLC has been proposed in which ALK IHC 2+ tumor cells would undergo ALK-FISH; 3+ cells would be reported as ALK-positive; 0 and 1+ cells would be reported as ALK-negative. However, no IHC assay for ALK rearrangements has been cleared by the FDA for IVD, and its use remains investigational. References 1. Choi YL, Takeuchi K, Soda M et al.

Cook, MD, PhD The most common form of acute leukemia in adults, acute myeloid leukemia (AML) represents a group of clonal hematopoietic disorders in which both failure to differentiate and uncontrolled proliferation in the stem cell compartment result in the accumulation of myeloid blasts.1,2 A diagnosis of AML is established through the identification of greater than 20% myeloid blasts in the bone marrow or peripheral blood. AML can be further subclassified into specific clinicopathologic entities that are characterized by distinct clinical features, differences in prognosis, and, in some cases, differences in terms of the optimal therapeutic management. a relatively good prognosis. In contrast, cases of AML with inv(3)(q21q26.2) RPN1-EVI1 are associated with a very aggressive clinical course and poor outcome. For this reason, metaphase cytogenetic analysis has long been considered part of the routine workup and classification of new AML. In more recent years, it has become clear that other distinct subtypes of AML can be identified on the basis of recurrent molecular abnormalities. The 2008 revision of the WHO classification (Table 1) of hematolymphoid tumors included two new provisional entities defined by the presence of specific mutations: AML with mutated NPM1 and AML with mutated CEBPA.1,2 Additional studies since 2008 have confirmed that Metaphase cytogenetic studies have been a critical part of AML diagnosis and classification for many years. Several disthese disorders represent distinct clinicopathologic entities.

Mutations in NPM1 are found in approximately one-third of AML, making this one of the most common abnormalities in AML. More than 40 different mutations in NPM1 have been described, but all represent small insertions (usually 4 nucleotides) in exon 12. Mutations in NPM1 can be identified by PCR of the relevant region of exon 12 followed by capillary electrophoresis to assess for the characteristic 4bp insertion. Cases of AML with mutated NPM1 often show monocytic Fall | 2012 Table 2.

The prognosis of NPM1-mutated AML varies depending on whether or not a FLT3 mutation is also present, as discussed below. FLT3 is a receptor tyrosine kinase normally expressed at the cell surface of hematopoietic precursors. Several types of mutations in FLT3 occur in AML, including internal tandem duplications (ITD), tyrosine kinase domain (TKD) mutations, and rarely juxtamembrane region mutations. The most clinically important of these mutations is the ITD, a variably sized duplication that occurs in exons 14-15. PCR for this region and subsequent fragment length analysis by capillary electrophoresis allows for the detection of this abnormality. FLT3-ITD mutations do not define a specific subtype of AML, but rather can be found in many different forms of AML. The FLT3-ITD is associated with unfavorable prognosis in AML. FLT3-TKD mutations also appear to be associated with a less favorable prognosis in many studies, although this remains somewhat controversial. The combination of NPM1 and FLT3-ITD status can be used to stratify prognosis in AML, especially in cases with normal karyotype by metaphase cytogenetics. An NPM+/FLT3-ITDgenotype is associated with a favorable clinical course, while a NPM1-/FLT3-ITD+ genotype is associated with poor outcome and other permutations are associated with intermediate prognosis. This information can be used to guide the choice of therapy, as NPM1+/FLT3-ITD- cases may not benefit from undergoing allogeneic bone marrow transplant, while other cases with other genotypic profiles may. The CEBPA gene, located at chromosome 19q13.1, encodes a transcription factor that is involved in differentiation of granulocytes. Mutations in CEBPA occur in 5-15% of AML and are extremely diverse. More than 100 different CEBPA mutations have been described, including point mutations, insertions and deletions. Due to this marked diversity, mutations in CEBPA are best detected by Sanger sequencing of the entire coding region. The majority of mutated cases show biallelic mutations in CEBPA, usually with one located in the N-terminal region and one located in the C-terminal region. Cases with mutated CEBPA, especially those with biallelic mutations, show a favorable prognosis similar to cases with an NPM1+/FLT3-ITD- genotype, and often show monocytic differentiation. Approximately 70% of cases are associated with a normal karyotype by metaphase cytogenetics. Gene expression profiling studies have shown that CEBPA mutated AML has a distinct genetic signature, providing further evidence that this represents a distinct subtype of AML. Mutations in the KIT gene on chromosome 4q12 can be found in approximately 17% of AML cases, including a variety of cytogenetic subtypes. KIT encodes a receptor tyrosine kinase that signals through several cellular pathways, and mutations in this gene lead to increased proliferation. KIT mutations are very heterogeneous, but the vast majority of mutations in AML are located in exons 8 and 17. These diverse mutations 3 Pathology Innovations | Clinical | Translational are best identified by Sanger sequencing. KIT abnormalities appear to be especially important in AML with t(8;21) or inv(16). These core binding factor leukemias are normally considered to be associated with good prognosis. The presence of a concurrent KIT mutation, however, is associated with intermediate risk disease, at least in t(8;21) positive cases. The effect on prognosis in inv(16) AML is more controversial and may be weaker. The significance of KIT mutations in other forms of AML remains uncertain. The NCCN and European LeukemiaNet guidelines currently include KIT mutation analysis only for cases carrying t(8;21) and inv(16). While NPM1, FLT3, CEBPA and KIT mutation studies are now widely accepted as standard practice in AML diagnosis and prognostic assessment, studies over the last several years have identified a diverse array of other recurrently mutated genes that are also associated with prognostic differences in AML. Some of the more widely studied abnormalities in this category include duplications in MLL and mutations in DNMT3A, RUNX1, TET2, EZH2, ASXL1, IDH1, IDH2 and TP53.5,6 AML researchers now face the challenge of determining which mutations, or combinations of these mutations, represent the most important abnormalities to identify, and how to use this information to guide selection of therapeutic regimens. For example, a recent landmark New England Journal of Medicine study by Patel et al7 examined mutations in 17 genes, and identified an 11-gene panel of abnormalities that greatly refines prognostic evaluation of AML. It is likely that the next few years will see numerous similar studies in an effort to define an optimal consensus panel. The major challenge for molecular diagnostic laboratories in this period will be to identify techniques to evaluate such genetic panels in a timely, cost-effective manner. The Department of Molecular Pathology at PLMI is currently exploring options for the use of next-generation sequencing technologies for such applications. Cost-effective utilization of molecular testing is possible using an algorithmic approach. Samples for metaphase cytogenetics and DNA extraction should be obtained in any bone marrow biopsy for suspected AML. Extracted DNA may then simply be held in the laboratory, pending results of metaphase cytogenetic studies. In the case of normal karyotype, reflex testing for 4 NPM1, FLT3, and CEBPA mutations is recommended. In the case of AML with t(8;21) or inv(16), KIT mutation studies may be performed. In contrast, in cases where metaphase cytogenetic results clearly identify a poor risk genotype, further molecular testing may not be necessary. This type of integrated, algorithmic approach is likely to become even more important as the number of mutational studies performed continues to grow in the future. References 1.

The impact of molecular diagnostics on the care of patients with CML has only grown with time, with integral components of contemporary management including disease-defining diagnostic tests, guiding choice of therapy, monitoring of response to therapy through minimal residual disease testing, and testing for development of resistance to therapy. In addition, recent updates, such as the 2012 National Comprehensive Cancer Network clinical practice guidelines and International Scale for standardization of reporting between laboratories, continue to advance the appropriate use of molecular diagnostics to optimize patient care. The development of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) such as imatinib revolutionized therapy for CML and has served as a model for other malignancies. After demonstration of its clinical utility, imatinib was approved for use in 2001 for the treatment of CML and was the first molecular-targeted therapy approved for use in human cancer. Other therapies, such as nilotinib, dasatinib and bosutinib have followed, with FDA approval of panotinib also anticipated. Since the introduction of imatinib, long-term survival rates for CML have increased to 95%, allowing better survival and quality of life when compared to previous therapeutic regimens. The transformation of CML treatment and course that was provided by tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) was largely made possible by early knowledge of the molecular genetic events that cause CML. CML has been known for decades as the myeloproliferative disease associated with the “Philadelphia chromosome,” an abnormally small chromosome 22 created by a reciprocal translocation of chromosomes 9 and 22. The BCR-ABL fusion gene created on this newly derived chromosome 22 gives rise to a chimeric fusion protein with abnormally enhanced and unregulated tyrosine kinase activity. Unchecked, this tyrosine kinase activity sends signals downstream for myeloid precursors to proliferate that result in CML. Testing at Diagnosis Since CML is a disease defined by the presence of the BCR-ABL fusion, a sensitive method of detecting the fusion is critical to accurate diagnosis. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) for BCR-ABL is a sensitive and specific method that is most widely used for diagnosis. Dual color, dual fusion probe strategies employ fluorescently labeled probes that span and flank the full range of breakpoints for both BCR and ABL, allowing a fusion signal to be detected regardless of which break point is present. Since the probe sets flank the breakpoints, the reciprocal translocation also creates two fusion signals, significantly enhancing specificity over single fusion strategies. FISH can be performed on interphase cells, so results are not dependent on cell culture, resulting in the ability to perform testing on a wider range of samples as well as a more rapid turnaround time than can be achieved by the culture-dependent cytogenetic karyotyping. Additionally, BCR-ABL fusions can be detected by FISH in rare Philadelphia chromosome-negative cases of CML. Comprehensive multiplex PCR strategies have also been employed as a reliable and sensitive means of detecting BCRABL fusions. This method provides the flexibility and sensitivity of FISH testing because it can be designed to detect all possible break points. It also provides information at diagnosis about which break points are present, which cannot be determined by FISH. Although cytogenetic karyotyping detects t(9:22) and complex translocations involving these chromosomes in most cases, a small percentage of cases is not detectable by this method and would be missed if cytogenetics were used alone. Cytogenetic karyotyping is also time consuming and may result in delayed diagnosis compared to other methods. However, cytogenetic karyotyping maintains value as a diagnostic tool because it provides information about abnormalities that may be present elsewhere within the karyotype, such as a second Philadelphia chromosome, trisomy 8 or isochromosome 17q. Since none of the other more targeted methods used in CML diagnosis detect these abnormalities, cytogenetic karyotyping provides information that is complementary to these other techniques. RT-PCR designed to detect the BCR-ABL transcript for the p210 fusion is a rapid and very analytically sensitive technique, but its use at initial diagnosis is limited since it detects only the p210 fusion. A negative result does not exclude CML since a small percentage of cases have alternate fusion transcripts that would be missed by a primer set designed to detect only 7 Pathology Innovations | Clinical | Translational the p210 fusion. Additionally, rare deletions occurring in or near the primers may cause false-negative results by PCR even when the correct breakpoints are targeted. In practice, molecular diagnostic testing for CML at diagnosis uses a combination of each of these methods. While FISH or multiplex PCR are best used to make the diagnosis, cytogenetic karyotyping provides complementary information regarding the presence of any other genetic abnormalities, and BCR-ABL RT-PCR is useful to provide a baseline level of fusion transcript for subsequent monitoring during therapy. Response to Therapy Although of limited use at initial diagnosis, RT-PCR for BCRABL p210 fusion is the gold standard for monitoring disease burden during therapy. BCR-ABL fusion transcripts are measured quantitatively over time to track response to therapy. The results are expressed in normalized copy number (NCN), the ratio of BCR-ABL copy number to the copy number of a control gene (often normal ABL), and compared to either the patient’s baseline NCN at diagnosis or a standardized baseline value. In tracking response to therapy, a major molecular response is defined as a 3 log reduction (or 0.1%) from this baseline value. One recent improvement to BCR-ABL quantitative testing is the use of standards and the International Scale (IS) to provide results that are comparable across different laboratories. Without the use of the International Scale, results can vary greatly between laboratories due to the many different methods used to obtain results. The International Scale uses calibrators of known concentrations derived from World Health Organization-certified NIBSC reference material for both BCR-ABL and ABL. By plotting patient results against the results of the calibration curves, the patient result can be converted to an International Scale value that is standardized across all different labs that use the IS. These standards have significantly advanced the efforts at inter-laboratory standardization and have improved the care of patients who are seen at more than one medical center. National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) Guidelines provide guidance for monitoring response to therapy in CML. Different levels and types of responses (hematologic, cytogenetic, molecular) are expected at different time points in order for a response to be considered optimal. For example, optimal responses based on the 2009 European LeukemiaNet (ELN) recommendations include complete hematologic response at 3 months, complete cytogenetic response at 12 months, and major molecular response at 18 months. Patient responses are categorized as optimal, sub-optimal or failure by NCCN 8 based on outcomes studies, and the criteria used for measuring response drive the specific methods used to monitor response at each time point. Although hematologic response and BCR-ABL fusion transcript levels can be determined from peripheral blood, cytogenetic karyotyping requires bone marrow sampling. 2012 National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) Guidelines The 2012 NCCN CML Guidelines update the recommendations for disease monitoring and therapy based on newly available outcomes studies. The updated guidelines generally seek to provide greater clarity surrounding when to alter the current course of therapy by changing to a different TKI based on sub-optimal and/or failure level responses, providing clinicians with a proposed course of action using the best tools and knowledge available. One significant change in the 2012 guidelines compared to the 2009 European LeukemiaNet (ELN) Recommendations is the emphasis on early response. At the three-month evaluation, continuation of current therapy requires that the patient is demonstrating optimal response (ie. complete hematologic and partial cytogenetic responses), and also places increased emphasis on early molecular response by adding a one log reduction of BCR-ABL fusion transcripts to the criteria for optimal response. This added criterion is based on studies showing improved long-term overall survival in patients that achieve a one log reduction after 3 months of imatinib therapy. For anything less than optimal response at 3 months, the NCCN guidelines recommend evaluation of patient compliance and possible drug-drug interactions, as well as ABL kinase mutation analysis for the purposes of switching to the appropriate second generation TKI. Another significant change in the 2012 update of NCCN guidelines is the de- emphasized importance of achieving a major molecular response (MMR) at 18 months. MMR was previously the sole criterion for optimal response in the 2009 ELN Recommendations. However many studies show that, among patients achieving complete cytogenetic response, the long-term survival does not vary significantly between those achieving MMR and those without MMR. The 2012 NCCN Guidelines therefore essentially lump optimal (MMR and complete cytogenetic response) and sub-optimal (complete cytogenetic response but no MMR) ELN responses together in order to make the more clinically important distinction between complete cytogenetic response and lack of complete cytogenetic response at 18 months. The lack of complete Fall | 2012 cytogenetic response is what drives evaluation for mutations and switching Table 1.

Failure to respond to TKI therapy At diagnosis, reliable and sensitive methods for detection of in CML or loss of response is often due to the emergence of a BCR-ABL fusion include fluorescence in situ hybridization and clone bearing a resistance-conferring ABL kinase mutation, some comprehensive multiplex RT-PCR assays. Cytogenetic and given the differential effects of these various mutation, karyotyping and PCR for the p210 fusion also detect the vast analysis of which mutation is present provides an important majority of CML cases, but they miss cases that are cytogecontribution to guiding choice of therapy.

The gene encoding the CYP2C19 protein is highly polymorphic, resulting in altered enzyme activity and wide variability among patients taking clopidogrel. Such varied response also can be associated with other drugs metabolized by CYP2C19 causing adverse drug events. A therapeutic approach that factors in the patient’s CYP2C19 gene polymorphisms to individualize drug options will enhance treatment efficacy and reduce adverse side effects. Genetic testing of CYP2C19 as a companion diagnostic can identify patients predisposed to varying efficacies of clopidogrel and other drugs metabolized by CYP2C19. Detection of three common variants in the CYP2C19 gene, including two nonfunctional alleles (*2 and *3) and one increased-function allele (*17) will facilitate tailoring individualized antithrombotic therapy such as an alternate dosage or alternate treatment. Other less frequent CYP2C19 non-function alleles (*4 to*8) and decreased-function alleles (*9 and *10) also may be associated with absent or reduced metabolism of clopidogrel and other drugs. Current Status of Clopidogrel Therapy Clopidogrel is an oral antiplatelet drug used to treat acute coronary syndromes, including patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), myocardial infarction (MI), cerebrovascular disease and peripheral arterial disease. Clopidogrel is typically prescribed at a daily dosage of 75 mg with or without an initial loading dose of 300-600 mg, as needed. In combination with a daily dose of 75-325 mg aspirin, clopidogrel is used at the 75 mg dosage to prevent stent thrombosis following PCI. The antithrombotic effect of clopidogrel is not optimal in all patients, and up to 30% of the patients receiving clopidogrel On the Cover: PLMI Chair Kandice Kottke-Marchant, MD, PhD, (seated) with Joyce Heesun Rogers, MD, PhD, and Gurunathan Murugesan, PhD, who collaborated on the development of an assay to identify genetic variants of CYP2C19 that impact drug metabolism. 2 do not benefit from the therapy as determined from measurement of residual platelet reactivity. Non-response or sub-optimal response to therapy can stem from pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, co-administration of other drugs and predisposition due to genetic, clinical and cellular factors. Genetically, certain polymorphisms in the gene encoding the CYP2C19 enzyme have been associated with poor metabolism of clopidogrel and subsequent decreased formation of active metabolite. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has issued a black box warning about the reduced effectiveness of clopidogrel in patients who metabolize the drug poorly. The FDA has indicated the availability of tests to identify genetic differences in CYP2C19 function and advised healthcare professionals to consider alternate therapy or dosing strategies for poor metabolizers. Clopidogrel Metabolism and Mechanism of Action Clopidogrel is metabolized in the liver by several CYP enzymes, including CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP3A4 and CYP3A5. Clopidogrel is largely (~85%) hydrolyzed by esterases into inactive metabolites, and only about 15% is converted into the active form by CYP enzymes. Of these, CYP2C19 plays a major role in the generation of the active metabolite. The active metabolite, an analogue of adenosine diphosphate (ADP), binds irreversibly to platelet ADP receptor P2RY12 to inhibit platelet aggregation and consequent thrombosis. The pharmacogenetics and mechanism of action of clopidogrel and other drugs metabolized by CYP2C19 are shown in Figure 1. Response to clopidogrel therapy is widely variable, which is attributed to at least three common variants in the CYP2C19 gene. The wild-type form of the CYP2C19 gene (*1) encodes an enzyme with normal activity (extensive metabolizer, EM) on which current drug dosing recommendations are based. Two other variants (*2 and *3) encode non-functional enzymes (poor metabolizer, PM). In contrast, a third variant (*17) encodes an enzyme with increased function (ultrametabolizer, UM). Individuals can inherit one wild-type allele and one non-functional allele (intermediate metabolizer, IM). As a result, CYP2C19*2 and CYP2C19*3 variants confer Winter | 2012 non-functional or markedly decreased metabolic status and have been associated with non-responsiveness to clopidogrel. Non-responsiveness is reflected in reduced platelet inhibition and poor outcomes, including increased risk for stent thrombosis, MI, stroke and death. On the other hand, CYP2C19*17 is associated with increased response to clopidogrel and risk for bleeding. Accordingly, while suboptimal response to clopidogrel can lead to thrombosis, super-optimal response can result in bleeding. Thus, the genetic testing of patients to determine CYP2C19 gene variants can enable individualized antithrombotic therapy, including alternate dosing or alternate therapy with an antiplatelet agent such as prasugrel (Effient®, Eli Lilly & Co., Indianapolis, Ind.). However, this genotyping assay should be used in conjunction with the aspirin/clopidogrel aggregation assay to determine platelet response to clopidogrel. Clinical Significance of CYP2C19 Genetic Testing The CYP2C19 isoenzyme metabolizes 5-10% of all prescription drugs, and poor metabolizers taking those drugs may be predisposed to adverse drug events due to underdosing or overdosing, depending on whether it is a pro-drug or active drug, respectively. It is estimated that 2-14% of the U.S. population are poor metabolizers. Pharmacokinetics of drugs and consequent therapeutic efficacy depend on the rate of activation or elimination. Poor metabolizers are likely to have reduced or no conversion rate of pro-drugs (e.g. clopidogrel, tamoxifen) to active drugs, resulting in either a sub-therapeutic effect or non-responsiveness (underdosing), which eventually require alternate treatment or increased dosage. Poor metabolizers also may have a reduced capacity to eliminate active drugs, e.g. omeprazole, diazepam (Valium®, Roche, Basel, Switzerland), leading to accumulation and toxicity, resulting in life-threatening side effects (overdosing). Such adverse effects can be predicted by determining the genotype-phenotype associations (Figure 1). The homozygous wild type allele of CYP2C19 designated CYP2C19*1, is defined as an EM. Nine common variants of the CYP2C19 gene associated with impaired drug metabolism include *2 to *10. While the wild-type form of the CYP2C19 gene (*1) encodes an enzyme with normal activity, other genetic variants (*2 to *8) encode enzymes with loss of activity, and two other variants (*9 and *10) have reduced activity. The most common PM phenotypes are from CYP2C19 with homozygous *2 and *3 alleles. Homozygous *4 to *8 alleles are less common PM; *9 and *10 alleles have reduced activity. One of the variants (*17) confers augmented enzyme activity, leading to a UM phenotype. Inheritance of one normal allele and one loss of function allele can result in an IM phenotype.

The assay involves multiplex PCR amplification of genomic DNA followed by allele-specific primer extension using fluorescently labeled dCTP and hybridization on to a microarray coated with capturing oligonucleotides, which are specific for complementary oligonucleotides linked to the allele specific primer-extended products. A built-in confocal microscope is enabled to capture fluorescent signal from the pre-determined hybridization spots corresponding to specific products and genotypes deciphered from signal ratio. Validation was performed following the guidelines of the Clinical Laboratory and Standards Institute (CLSI). Accuracy of the CYP2C19 test was evaluated by genotyping specimens (n=69) of known genotypes and comparing the results for a subset of specimens (n=26) genotyped in an external reference laboratory that uses the same assay system. Interand intra-assay precision and the limit of detection were determined using three specimens representing extensive, intermediate and poor metabolizers. Specificity of the assay was confirmed by specified criteria. Interpretation of the CYP2C19 Genetic Test This genetic test is used to identify patients at risk for adverse events and to determine appropriate therapy by • Detecting six variants of the CYP2C19 gene associated with a non-functional enzyme CYP2C9*2, *3, *4, *6, *7, and *8 • Detecting two variants of the CYP2C19 gene associated with a decreased-function enzyme CYP2C9*9 and *10 • Detecting one variant of the CYP2C19 gene associated with an increased-function enzyme CYP2C9*17 Interpretation of the assay is based on the presence of specific genetic variants of CYP2C19 (Table 1). treatment or increased dosage. Conversely, administration of active drugs, such as diazepam and omeprazole, may result in impaired elimination, potential risk of drug toxicity and life-threatening side effects, also requiring an alternate treatment or reduced dosage. 2. Individuals with CYP2C19 variant alleles designated *9 and *10 have decreased functional activity. Such individuals may experience sub-therapeutic effects for pro-drugs. Con- versely, administration of active drugs may result in impaired elimination and potential risk of drug toxicity. 3. Individuals with CYP2C19 variant alleles designated *17 have augmented enzyme activity compared to *1 (wild-type) individuals, leading to increased conversion of pro-drugs to active metabolites with potential risk for toxicity and requiring reduced dosage. Conversely, it also may lead to rapid elimination of active drugs and sub-therapeutic effects. 4. Individuals with a CYP2C19 genotype comprised of one of the non-functional alleles (*2, *3, *4, *6, *7 or *8) and *17 have an unknown metabolizer phenotype. Due to the low population frequency of these alleles, the level of CYP2C19 activity cannot be predicted based on genotype. 5. Individuals with a CYP2C19 genotype comprised of one of the reduced-function alleles (*9 or *10) and *17 have an unknown metabolizer phenotype. Due to the low population frequency of these alleles, the level of CYP2C19 activity cannot be predicted based on genotype. 6. Prevalence of CYP2C19 gene variants differs depending on racial and ethnic background. The frequency of allele CYP2C19*2 has been reported as approximately 30-35% in Asians and 15-26% in Caucasians and African Americans. The frequency of allele CYP2C19*3 has been reported as approximately 10% in Asians and less than 2% in Caucasians and African Americans. Limitations of the CYP2C19 Genetic Test Analysis for specific genetic variants detected in this test does not rule out the possibility of the presence of other variant 1. Individuals with CYP2C19 variant alleles designated *2, *3, alleles that may influence drug effects and metabolism. Non *4, *6, *7 and *8 have no functional activity compared with genetic factors such as concurrent medications, impaired hepatic function, obesity, insulin resistance and non-compli *1 (wild-type) individuals. Administration of a pro-drug such as clopidogrel can result in markedly reduced or no ance can also affect CYP2C19 metabolism. These can lead to increases or decreases in function relative to the predicted conversion to the active metabolite and a subtherapeutic genotype. effect or non-responsiveness, which require an alternate 4 Winter | 2012 CYP2C19 mediates the metabolic activation and elimination, and hence the therapeutic effect, of a variety of drugs including anticonvulsants, antidepressants, antimalarial drugs, antithrombotics, antiulcer drugs, beta blockers, antineoplastic drugs and proton pump inhibitors. Co-administration of drugs metabolized by CYP2C19 may increase or decrease the CYP2C19 activity. Drugs metabolized by CYP2C19 are listed in Table 2. CYP2C19 genotyping should not replace clinical monitoring of patients when required. Genotype-phenotype interpretation should be made in the context of a patient’s clinical condition and concomitant medications, which may be substrates, inhibitors or inducers of CYP2C19. For clopidogrel therapy, this genotyping assay should be interpreted in conjunction with the aspirin/clopidogrel aggregation assay as a functional screen to determine platelet response to clopidogrel.

Winter | 2012 Latest Advances in Treatment of Blood Disorders PLMI Reports from ASH Annual Meeting Cleveland Clinic was a dominant presence at the American Society for Hematology (ASH) annual meeting in San Diego in December, presenting 112 abstracts and posters. Department of Clinical Pathology Chairman Eric Hsi, MD, co-authored six of these abstracts with colleagues from Clinical Pathology, Cleveland Clinic Taussig Cancer Institute and the Department of Hematology and Oncology. Eric Hsi, MD Xiaoxian Zhao, PhD ASH is the world’s largest professional society concerned with the causes and treatments of blood disorders. The following is a summary of Dr. Hsi’s abstracts and their conclusions. The t(14;18)(q32;q21) Characterizes a Subset of Patients with Diffuse Large-B Cell Lymphoma of Germinal Center Origin with Poor Outcome: Report From the International DLBCL Rituximab-CHOP Consortium Program Study Patients with the GCB subtype and t(14;18) exhibit a significantly worse prognosis than patients without t(14;18) when treated with R-CHOP. The assessment of t(14;18) by FISH approach not only functions as a valuable prognosticator for individual risk estimation in GCB-DLBCL patients in addition to the established parameters, but also provides valuable result for therapeutic intervention. A Proof of Principle Clinical Trial in Myelodysplastic Syndromes of Non-Cytotoxic Differentiation Therapy with Decitabine This study provides clinical proof of principle that a decitabine regimen rationalized for non-cytotoxic epigenetic-differentiation effects is active in myeloid malignancy, correlates with molecular markers of terminal differentiation, and has potentially important safety and efficacy advantages over cytotoxic therapy that warrant further evaluation and optimization. Phospho-SFKs (Y416) As a Potential Predictive Marker for Dasatinib Therapy in B-Cell Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma and Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (Co-author Xiaoxian Zhao, PhD, PLMI Department of Clinical Pathology) P-SFK (Y416) may be a useful predictive marker of response to dasatinib. Potential uses include pharmacodynamic monitoring or integral biomarker for selecting appropriate patients with B-cell malignancies for clinical trials. Cell of Origin Determination in Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma: Performance of Immunohistochemical (IHC) Algorithms and Ability to Predict Outcome The Hans and Choi algorithms are reasonable methods for identifying PFS and OS differences based on CoO for de novo DLBCL treated with chemoimmunotherapy. The positive predictive value is universally high for all algorithms tested, but the sensitivity of IHC for identifying CoO was fair, particularly for the Tally method. IHC represents a valid biomarker to identify non-GCB cases. Clinical trials of DLBCL that stratify patients by IHC are feasible provided the performance characteristics of the algorithms are taken into consideration during study design. Whole Genome and Exome Sequencing Reveals the Genetic Landscape of Burkitt Lymphoma This study represents one of the first in-depth analyses of a BL genome and one of the largest applications of exome sequencing in cancer. Our data provide the most comprehensive genetic portrait of human BL to date, and provides a significant first step to identifying the genetic causes of the disease. The Impact of Molecular Lesions in Post-Transplant Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) in Correlation with Cytogenetic Abnormalities Preliminary results suggest that myeloablative AlloHCT could minimize the prognostic impact of adverse molecular markers in AML. These mutations potentially serve as important biomarkers in determining the management of AML. Further studies designed to determine their precise role are planned. New Combination Therapy for Relapsed/Refractory Multiple Myeloma Enters Phase III Trials Building on initial pre-clinical work done in part at Cleveland Clinic by Dr. Hsi with collaborators at Protein Design Labs (ASH 2006 and Hsi ed et al. Clin Cancer Res. 2008), clinical investigators reported Phase II results of elotuzomab with lenalidomide and low dose dexamethasone in patients with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma (abstract 303). Patients demonstrated a 92% overall response rate, and this novel monoclonal antibody is now being evaluated in Phase III trials. 7 Pathology Innovations | Clinical | Translational The Cleveland Clinic Pathology & Laboratory Medicine Institute (PLMI) has expanded its laboratory space on main campus with the January opening of a new, state-of-the-art, 138,000-square-foot facility. The building was designed by Vlad Novakovic of Perspectus Architecture and laboratory architect Roger Maynard. 8 Winter | 2012 Pathology & Laboratory Medicine Institute Building Combines Lean with Green The new building, situated at the eastern end of the Cleveland Clinic campus on Carnegie Avenue, houses central processing, microbiology, molecular pathology, immunology and special chemistry laboratories, and Cleveland Clinic Laboratories’ administration, marketing and logistics. 9 Pathology Innovations | Clinical | Translational “The role of pathology and laboratory medicine in patient care is going to grow exponentially over the next decade. The Pathology & Laboratory Medicine Institute is now positioned to take advantage of the opportunities that growth will bring in testing, technology and training.” — Kandice Kottke-Marchant, MD, PhD, PLMI Chair David Bosler, MD, Head, Cleveland Clinic Laboratories, adds, “The new building doubles our laboratory space. We have added staff as well as space, which will allow us to expand our test menu and our capacity and service our customers more efficiently and effectively.” The building incorporates Lean engineering and design principles, which focus on eliminating wasted effort, time and physical resources. By applying Lean principles, the goal was to create a lab where the techs can spend more time performing critical tasks and less time walking, searching and waiting, explains Joe Seestadt, PLMI Director of Continuous Improvement. “Incorporating the continuous improvement elements of workbench optimization, specimen delivery and inventory management from the planning stage will ensure that the labs can function at optimal efficiency and turnaround time,” he notes. A total of 67 front-line laboratory technologists, coordinators and managers were involved in the design process through nine two-day Kaizen events. With their input, the overall result was a streamlined laboratory operation that: • cut out 200 wasteful activities such as inefficient walking patterns and waiting time, • increased the percentage of laboratory workstations in the most efficient location from 62 percent to 91 percent, • increased the percentage of work steps performed within the optimal window from 38 percent to 91 percent, • incorporated a more efficient inventory management system that decreased order replenishment time from 15 to three days and • implemented a water spider delivery concept that uses offline associates to deliver specimens directly to techs. In addition to the tangible benefits, “Involving front-line staff in the process increased employee engagement and made employees aware that their opinions count because their ideas were used,” Seestadt adds. 10 Winter | 2012 The new building’s first floor houses a new, expanded Microbiology lab and a spacious central processing area designed to optimize specimen handling and reduce turnaround times. The second floor is home to Molecular Pathology and is fully equipped for the continued expansion in FISH, CISH, PCR and other molecular assays for DNA, RNA and protein analysis. The expanded Cytogenetics laboratory will allow for growth in in-house test volume and introduction of a cytogenetics technology training program.

PSA screening typically is used in conjunction with the digital rectal examination (DRE) and, in men with elevated PSA level, is followed by a biopsy. The PSA threshold for biopsy, originally 10 ng/mL, has been adjusted several times, and today the usual recommendation is to biopsy when serum PSA level >2.5ng/mL. The lowering of the PSA threshold has resulted in an increase in the number of biopsies. However, the positive predictive value of PSA and DRE are low, 25-30% and <20%, respectively (1), which means that many initial biopsies are negative. The Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial risk calculator demonstrates a significant risk of positive biopsy following one previous negative biopsy, independent of changes in PSA (2). This has resulted in a high rate of repeat biopsies in an effort to detect potentially harmful prostate cancer unrecognized in the initial biopsy. While PSA is a useful marker for prostatic adenocarcinoma, its utility is limited because it is prostate-specific but not cancer-specific; consequently, there is no PSA lower limit of detection for which the risk of prostate cancer is zero. For predicting biologically significant disease, the predictive value of PSA is limited because higher grade tumors often express little PSA. Decisions regarding the need for re-biopsy in men with an elevated PSA are limited because PSA usually is more reflective of prostate volume rather than the risk of carcinoma. The Role of the PCA3 Assay The prostate cancer gene 3 (PCA3) assay is a genetic-based diagnostic test for prostate cancer that meets the need for a test with greater predictive value than the serum PSA. PCA3 is highly specific for prostate cancer and capable of distinguishing between clinically significant and insignificant prostate cancer and, therefore, can support more appropriate use of biopsy and reduces the risk of overtreatment. PCA3 is expressed only in prostate tissue and is significantly overexpressed in malignant prostate tissue. The PCA3 gene’s messenger RNA is highly overexpressed (median 66-fold) 12 in more than 95% of prostate cancer tissue compared with expression in normal or benign prostate tissue from the same patients (3,4). PCA3 is specifically expressed by prostate carcinoma cells. The PCA3 assay addresses many of the issues related to serum PSA screening, improves the sensitivity and specificity of PSA interpretation and may add other information more reflective of tumor biology. The PCA3 assay is a simple urine test that detects the presence of PCA3 mRNA. It is performed on 2.5 mL first-catch urine collected from the patient post-DRE. When transported under prescribed conditions, the specimen is stable at 4°C for 21 days and 5 days at 30°C. In step 1 (top), target capture of the mRNA is performed, using magnetic bead (purple). In step 2 (center), the captured gene is amplified using transcriptionmediated amplification, a process that generates some 10 billion copies of PCA3 in one hour. In step 3 (bottom), the hybridization protection assay is performed using DNA probes tagged with a chemiluminescent substance that is activated upon contact with detection reagents.

Accuracy of the assay is independent of prostate volume or total PSA. PCA3 and Biopsy The current research focus is on the appropriate use and timing of the PCA3 assay in the prostate cancer diagnostic algorithm. In a study of 260 American men with serum PSA of 8ng/mL, 111 men (43%) had a positive first biopsy. For men with a PCA3 score ≥ 35, the risk of positive biopsy was double that of men with a PCA3 score < 35. Men with a PCA3 score ≥ 35 had a 62% probability of a positive biopsy (5). Several studies have proposed that a PCA3 assay should routinely follow an initial biopsy, regardless of biopsy results. Haese and colleagues (6) demonstrated a direct correlation between PCA3 score and positive repeat biopsy — the higher the PCA3 score, the higher the probability of a positive repeat biopsy. When the PCA3 score was 10, specificity for a positive repeat biopsy was 28%; when the PCA3 score increased to 35, specificity increased to 72%; when PCA3 score rose to 50, specificity was 81%. Likewise, the lower the PCA3 score, the lower the risk of a positive repeat biopsy. In their study of 233 American men with an average PSA of 7.4 ng/mL and at least one negative biopsy, Marks and colleagues found that 60 men (27%) had a positive repeat biopsy (7). As PCA3 score increased, the percentage of men with a positive biopsy increased. Men with a PCA3 score ≥ 35 had a 2.5-fold increased risk of a positive biopsy compared to those with a PCA3 score < 35. In those men with a PCA3 score ≥ 35, the probability of a positive biopsy was 43%. The correlation between PCA3 score and positive biopsy was demonstrated further in the REDUCE trial. In a population of 1140 men with a PSA of 2.5-10ng/mL and a negative initial biopsy, the second biopsy was positive in 18% of subjects. 13 Pathology Innovations | Clinical | Translational Among those with a PCA3 score > 35, the risk of a positive repeat biopsy increased 3.5-fold. In subjects with a negative biopsy at two years, PCA3 score was predictive of a positive biopsy at four years. In subjects with a negative biopsy at year two and a PCA3 score > 35, the risk of a positive biopsy at year four was doubled (8). Clinical Use of PCA3 Treatment for men with a positive biopsy and organ-contained disease may range from watchful waiting to radical prostatectomy, depending on tumor volume and grade. PCA3 offers a simple, noninvasive means to assist in treatment decisions derived from the assay’s correlation with tumor volume. Nakanishi et al (9) demonstrated a correlation between low PCA3 and low tumor volume, as measured in radical prostatectomy specimens. In 34 men with an average PCA3 score of 48.1, tumor volume was >2.0 mL; in 27 men with an average PCA3 score of 21.5, tumor volume was <0.5 mL. These investigators concluded that “PCA3 score is significantly lower (28.5) in low volume/low grade prostate cancer compared with PCA3 scores (58.5) in significant prostate cancer” and that “PCA3 was the best predictor of total tumor volume in prostatectomy.” The authors suggested that a low PCA3 score signifies low volume, low grade disease, a conclusion that will require additional studies and confirmation by other investigators. The medical and scientific community has adopted a PCA3 score of 35 as the cut-off for biopsy. This score appears to balance sensitivity and specificity to provide the greatest accuracy in predicting the results of an initial biopsy so that unnecessary biopsy can be avoided with minimal risk of missing clinically significant disease. The PCA3 assay fills the need for a noninvasive diagnostic test for prostate cancer with higher specificity than serum PSA. The PCA3 assay has a role in cancer diagnosis and treatment planning by its ability to more accurately identify those men most likely to have a positive biopsy, thus reducing unnecessary biopsy and improving patient care by supporting better treatment decisions. 14 References 1.

Richter, MD Clinical microbiology laboratories perform essential tests to diagnose and guide the treatment of infections. One of the most common microbiologic tests performed is bacterial culture of specimens such as blood, cerebrospinal fluid, urine or sputum. The specimen is inoculated to nutritive media followed by incubation. Each type of colony that grows on the plate must be identified and classified as normal flora or a possible pathogen causing infection. Despite this age of advanced medical technology, days are often required to identify organisms recovered from culture. Recently, clinical microbiology laboratories throughout the world have begun to implement new mass spectrometry technology for organism identification. This proteomic method is faster and more accurate than the biochemical identification performed routinely in most clinical laboratories. Mass spectrometry (MS) has been used for the past 50 years to ionize and then identify molecules by determining their individual mass-to-charge (m/z) ratio. Early MS ionization methods were destructive and could not be used to analyze large molecules such as proteins. A soft ionization technique (matrix assisted laser desorption/ionization, MALDI) that does not fragment large molecules was invented in the 1980s.1 A matrix solution (usually a-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid) protects large molecules from fragmentation by absorbing photonic energy from the laser (“desorption”). Single-charged molecules are created and travel in a tube toward a detector. The time of flight (TOF) is directly proportional to mass and used to calculate a mass-to-charge ratio. Charting of the mass-to-charge ratios for individual ions creates a series of peaks called a spectrum that is compared to a reference database (Fig 1). Increasing availability of gene sequences for microorganisms led to the recognition that many of the mass spectral peaks in the 2,000-20,000 dalton range represent ribosomal proteins.2 Other peaks represent proteins that play key roles in cell function and structure. The stability and reproducibility of mass spectral patterns make MALDITOF MS a robust identification method. The accuracy of MALDI-TOF MS bacterial and yeast identifications is similar 2 to more labor intensive and expensive gene sequencing methods.3-6 Using one of the two MALDI-TOF MS systems currently available in the United States is simple. A small amount of bacterial growth from a culture plate is applied to a target plate and covered with 1 µl of matrix solution. For yeast, an extraction step with application of 0.5 µl formic acid directly to the isolate is required before the matrix overlay. The target plate is placed in the instrument where a laser irradiates the sample to create ions inside the instrument’s vacuum chamber. The time of flight before detection of these electrically charged particles is based on their particular masses and used to create a spectrum or “signature.” Computer software compares the spectrum to a database and if there is a match the identification is generated within minutes of ionization. The purchase price of a MALDI-TOF MS system is approximately $200,000, but the labor and reagent cost to generate the identification is ≤ $.50.6,7 Manufacturers of MALDI-TOF MS systems are initially seeking FDA clearance for identification of bacteria and yeast isolates from culture. Studies show MALDI-TOF MS will also reliably identify mycobacterial and mould isolates.8,9 In addition to testing pure culture isolates growing on solid media, there are other applications of MALDI-TOF MS in clinical microbiology. Organisms from positive blood culture broths can be identified by MALDI-TOF MS after additional processing steps if the broth does not contain charcoal.10-11 Bacteria causing urinary tract infections can be detected by performing MS directly on urine samples if the bacteria are present in high numbers.12 However, lower levels of bacteria that may also represent an infection are not reliably detected in urine. Although the hydrolysis of carbapenems by bacterial isolates has been demonstrated after a short incubation (≤2.5 h),13 other mechanisms of carbapenem resistance such as porin mutations or efflux cannot be detected by MALDI-TOF MS. Until the FDA has reviewed multicenter clinical trial data for MALDI-TOF MS systems, these devices are considered research-use-only technology. Laboratories must validate a system internally according to CLIA guidelines before using MS technology to provide identifications of organisms that guide clinical care. Rapid organism identification allows clinicians to prescribe the most appropriate treatment for infections sooner and de-escalate therapy from broad-spectrum agents that drive antimicrobial resistance. The development of MALDI-TOF MS allowing more accurate identifications of bacteria and yeast in minutes rather than days is an important innovation that should improve clinical outcomes.

These infections can range from a mild, self-limiting illness to severe disease that can cause death. More severe disease is seen in the young, the immunocompromised and the elderly. It is estimated that an average 24,000 deaths annually are attributed to influenza in the United States.1 In children, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the most common cause of severe lower respiratory tract infection worldwide. Timely detection of these viruses can lead to initiation of proper antiviral treatment, decreased use of unnecessary antibiotics, reduced transmission of disease from person to person and better clinical outcomes.2 Due to low sensitivity of respiratory viral rapid antigen tests and the long turn-around time of viral culture, many laboratories are using PCR-based methods for detection of respiratory viruses.3 Many laboratories have used multiplexed Respiratory Viral Panel (RVP) tests during the past two to three years. These multiplex RVP tests have demonstrated the ability to detect many respiratory viruses in most patients with influenza-like illness (ILI). However, some of these multiplex RVP tests are labor intensive with long turnaround and hands-on times before results are available (usually between 7-9 hours per run). eSensor technology from GenMark Diagnostics (GenMarkDx, Carlsbad, CA) is a novel assay that uses a solid-phase electrochemical method on the XT-8 platform for detection of nucleic acid targets. Targets are detected by a voltage change when DNA binds to capture probes on a gold electrode. We evaluated the eSensor RVP that includes 7 different viruses with a total of 14 targets used for subtyping with our current PCR multiplex method that includes a small multiplex RVP. (Flu A, Flu B and RSV plus DFA for the remaining 5 respiratory viruses.) (Table 1) Table 1.

Samples were tested with the eSensor XT-8 system and IUO respiratory viral panel kit (GenMark Diagnostics, Inc.) according to the package insert. Nucleic acids were extracted from 200 µl of each specimen using the easyMAG (bioMerieux, Inc.) after the addition of 10 µl of bacteriophage MS2 internal control (included in the kit). Conventional endpoint PCR was performed (using TC9700) in 35 µl volumes using 5 µl of extracted sample and the multiplex master mix provided in the kit. The thermal cycling protocol consisted of 1 cycle at 50°C for 30 minutes for reverse transcription; 1 cycle at 95°C for initial PCR activation; followed by 40 3-step cycles of 30 seconds at 94°C, 60 seconds at 60°C and 60 seconds at 72°C for 5 Pathology Innovations | Clinical | Translational denaturation, annealing and extension, respectively. After PCR, 5 µl of exonuclease was added to each reaction and the mixture was returned to the thermal cycler for 20 minutes at 37°C to create single-stranded DNA, followed by 2 minutes at 95°C for enzyme inactivation. 100 µl of hybridization buffer that contained ferrocene-labeled signal probes specific for the viral targets was added to each reaction. 125 µl of the mixture was added to the test cartridge, which was loaded onto the eSensor XT-8 instrument for analysis. Results Patient demographics are summarized in Table 2. Adults and children were sampled and there was an approximate equal distribution of inpatients, outpatients and emergency room patients. Of the 259 samples evaluated, 130 (50.1%) were positive for at least one virus. Twenty-three samples (8.8%) detected at least 2 viruses. A total of 157 respiratory viruses were detected with the most prevalent being HRV (9.3%), Flu A 2009 H1N1 (8.1%) and Flu B (7.7%). For 86 of the results, the eSensor and culture/DFA results were concordant. There were 71 samples in which the DFA was negative while the RVP was positive. After sequencing analysis, 64 of 71 (90.1%) results were concordant with the RVP results giving an overall concordance of 95.5%. Results Culture/DFA comparator testing was performed on all samples (R-mix for culture and IFA using monoclonal antibodies specific for various respiratory viruses).

Therefore, we feel our results are generalizable to other patient populations. This assay is an innovative multiplex test for the detection of an expanded panel of respiratory viruses. It is especially suitable for immunocompromised and hospitalized patients with respiratory symptoms that can be undiagnosed with conventional testing. Its ease of use allows the eSensor RVP to be easily implemented in a busy hospital laboratory. The eSensor RVP test has been FDA cleared for in vitro diagnosis use (2012). References 1.

Compounding these financial challenges are issues related to maintaining sufficient numbers of technical staff to perform laboratory testing. A recent national survey of laboratory managers estimates that approximately 13% of the current laboratory workforce may retire in the next several years. Many labs currently face vacancy rates of 5 to 10% for bench-level technologists and technicians.2 Laboratories often turn to automating procedures traditionally performed by manual methods to address labor shortages, reduce costs and decrease turnaround times. Automation has been routine in chemistry and hematology laboratories for decades. With the exception of instruments that perform DNA extraction and amplification by polymerase chain reaction, automation is relatively rare in microbiology laboratories. In fact, the main test offered in microbiology, routine culture, has remained relatively unchanged for about a century. By and large, specimens suspected to harbor bacterial and fungal pathogens are still cultured on agar media, where significant pathogens can be identified and tested for susceptibility to a panel of relevant antibiotics. However, one key critical step of the culture method – the initial planting or processing of the specimen onto the agar plate media – can now be automated. Specimens commonly processed in microbiology include urine, stool, sputum, swabs from wounds, tissues and body fluids. Careful specimen processing takes time and must be performed consistently, without contamination of the cultures with extraneous environmental organisms. For some specimen types, planting a calibrated sample volume onto the agar may be required for proper interpretation of results. With an eye toward standardizing this process and decreasing the time required for manual processing, several commercial companies have developed automated instruments capable of doing the work of human hands.5 Cleveland Clinic’s Robert J. Tomsich Pathology and Laboratory Medicine Institute recently invested in an instrument manufactured by Copan™ called the Walk Away Specimen Processor, or WASP™. This instrument is capable of transferring liquid specimens to agar plates using standard bacteriologic loops 8 and streaking methods. Utilizing barcodes on the side of sample tubes or cups, the microprocessor within the WASP reads the label and is able to plant a predetermined volume of the specimen according to stored protocols. The planting protocol is based on the specimen source and is taken directly from provider orders placed in the laboratory information system. The instrument is capable of vortexing the specimen, decapping the tube, planting, streaking and then recapping each sample tube before moving on to the next. Tubes and containers of various sizes can be accepted. The WASP streaks the plates using streaking patterns chosen by the operator. Agar plates are sorted according to incubation temperature and atmosphere, further reducing plate manipulation. One important caveat to automated specimen processing is the need for specimens that are liquid. Non-liquid specimens cannot be managed. Fortunately, for the typical microbiology laboratory, the majority of samples cultured on agar media are urine. Stool specimens in Cary Blair transport, swabs in liquid solution and body fluids may also be accommodated. To increase capacity, Copan has developed a proprietary chemical agent that can be used to liquefy sputum specimens so that sputum may also be included in the repertoire of samples. Tissues, hardware and specimens for mycobacterial culture are among specimens unsuitable for automated processing at this time. We estimate that about 70% of the clinical specimens currently manually streaked for culture may be placed on the WASP. In addition to plating and streaking the sample onto the agar, the WASP labels the plates, using information downloaded through an interface connected to the laboratory information system. These three steps (planting, streaking and labeling) accomplish the major time savings. Estimates from timing studies performed in the laboratory with urine specimens suggest that the WASP will save 18 and 40 seconds per sample in labeling and planting/streaking, respectively. When those numbers are multiplied by hundreds of specimens each day, significant savings may be achieved. Although the major function of the WASP is to plant specimens and streak the agar plates, the WASP has been designed as a modular system. Additional features include a gram stain preparation station, a broth planting and subculture module, and a station that can set up plates for susceptibility testing by the Kirby-Bauer method. In the future, we expect it to be able to spot targets for MALDI TOF analysis. The major benefit of the WASP is in savings of technical time for laboratory personnel. Technical staff may be repurposed to duties more suited to their level of education, increasing job satisfaction. Reducing the number of repetitive motions performed by human hands can also contribute to an improved work experience for employees by decreasing stress on tendons and joints. Other benefits are also expected. In clinical laboratories, human errors such as not inoculating or streaking plates or selection of the wrong plates for culture do occur. As the instrument works from information stored in the barcode, these types of errors should be very rare as long as the correct information is put into the laboratory information system. Cross-contamination of specimens and maintaining accuracy and reproducibility can be challenging when multiple personnel perform specimen processing. Although studies with clinical specimens cultured in real time are lacking, publications in which spiked urine specimens were alternated Spring | 2013 with sterile saline demonstrated no cross-contamination between samples when automated specimen processing instruments, including the WASP, were assessed.3,4 Our evaluation of the WASP (unpublished) and one published study show it to be accurate compared to current manual methods.3 Differences in technique between technical personnel can contribute to lack of reproducibility.1 Planting and streaking accomplished with the WASP robotic arm attached to a calibrated loop should enhance reproducibility of results. The WASP is but one example of how automation microbiology is catching up to other sections of clinical pathology. To complement automated specimen processing, industry experts are currently developing fully automated culture systems.6 In the future we will likely see processing instrumentation attached to conveyors leading into incubators. Camera systems that can detect microbial growth on agar plates have been developed. It will be possible for an automated system to read cultures via a camera and discard negative plates without human intervention. Positive cultures might even be evaluated 9 Pathology Innovations | Clinical | Translational About the Author by staff in remote locations. The technologist could then send a plate with significant growth to an automated instrument that can select colonies and setup identification and susceptibility testing, as directed by the user. Several companies are developing such systems and some large labs in Europe already have begun to implement this technology. Classical microbiology is evolving. It will be interesting to see how these innovations will fit into clinical practice in the future. References 1. Albers AC, Fletcher RD. 1983. Accuracy of calibrated-loop transfer.

Procop, MD, MS There is a great opportunity for pathologists and other laboratorians to take a leadership role in decreasing unnecessary phlebotomy and potentially iatrogenic anemia, increasing patient satisfaction and decreasing overall costs by developing and implementing strategies to reduce inappropriate laboratory testing. Unnecessary testing presents patient satisfaction and safety issues. The more tests performed, the greater the potential for error. From a patient satisfaction standpoint, it stands to reason that fewer phlebotomies would be associated with greater satisfaction. Finally, overutilization of laboratory testing creates unnecessary financial burdens for hospitals, patients and third-party payers in this ever-tightening era of healthcare reform. Addressing this issue at Cleveland Clinic was a substantial challenge, given the sheer size of this tertiary care medical center, the volume of laboratory testing and the complexity of our patient population. The keys to our success are summarized below. Keys to Our Success • A multidisciplinary Test Utilization Committee, with individuals representing many areas of the organization. • An open, transparent and collaborative process. • Team members focused on optimal patient care, improving the patient experience, decreasing phlebotomy and reducing costs. • Participants are more interested in improving patient care than reducing costs. • Collaborative meeting with mutual respect, acceptance, and healthy and collegial debate and innovation. • Rational, evidence-based initiatives. • Good project management with regular results reporting with shared success. • Leadership support. • Top down support with bottom up teambuilding. • Inclusion of high-level partners from information technology. • The ability of IT to rapidly respond to change requests. • ‘Pre-selling’ initiatives with the opportunity for feedback. • Anyone affected by a decision should be involved in the decision. • A willingness to learn and change. • Recognizing you don’t have to win every battle to win the war. Our efforts are led by the Test Utilization Committee, whose members truly adhere to Cleveland Clinic’s “Patients First” principle. We would never compromise the quality of care for cost savings. However, we recognized that there was substantial waste in the system and that better utilization of these resources could also contribute to enhanced patient care by bettering the system as a whole. The Same Day Duplicate Test Reduction Initiative The advent of CPOE systems allows for the opportunity to interact with physicians at the point-of-test entry, so as to assist with optimal ordering. Such methods can be used to guide physicians to the correct test, when the test selection is complex and it can be used to notify the physicians of duplicate test orders. Our initial foray into the use of best practice alerts (BPA) had mixed results. The BPA designed was essentially a “pop-up” window that notified the physician that the test they were trying to order had already been ordered that day. These studies provided evidence that a hard stop option should be explored to eliminate or drastically reduce unnecessary, duplicate testing. 2 Fall | 2013 The Test Utilization Committee first identified 10 tests that were deemed never to be needed more than once per day. Although we were allowed to initiate a full electronic stop on these duplicate orders, we were also required to build an alternative avenue for ordering, in the event the attending physician absolutely wanted the repeat test. There were no provider complaints associated with this initiative, so we progressively activated the hard stop clinical decision support tool (CDST) for all tests that the Test Utilization Committee deemed to be appropriate. In its first full year of implementation, the use of this CDST resulted in the discontinuation of 7,243 unnecessary duplicate orders. The total laboratory cost avoidance (i.e. materials plus labor) was $115,590. Costs associated with providers either performing phlebotomies (i.e. nurse draws) or responding to duplicate test results was not captured, but may be equally significant. This initiative is considered a success, since it is thought to have improved patient care and satisfaction by decreasing unnecessary phlebotomies and decreased costs. Restricting the Ordering of Genetic Test Genetic testing has become extremely complex and costly. We were concerned with test ordering patterns, since there were very few individuals who could adequately interpret these tests, yet any intern or resident could order the assay. Therefore, we undertook our second major initiative, which was limiting the individuals who could order complex molecular genetic tests, some of which cost thousands of dollars. We offered “deemed status” to physicians who were knowledgeable about the diseases for which the tests were designed. These individuals could order molecular genetic tests on an outpatient basis, whereas inpatient testing required a consultation with Medical Genetics. This initiative resulted in an annual cost avoidance of $248,923. Genetic Test Restricted Use Cost Savings and Orderable Volume Reduction $90,000 25 $80,000 Although there were relatively few tests averted each month through the Restricted Use initiative (Blue Line), there was still substantial cost avoidance appreciated, since these tests were all expensive (Green Line). $70,000 20 $60,000 15 $50,000 $40,000 10 $30,000 $20,000 5 Cost Savings Orders Restricted $10,000 $0 0 NOV 2011 DEC 2011 JAN 2012 FEB 2012 MAR 2012 APR 2012 MAY 2012 JUNE 2012 JULY 2012 AUG 2012 SEPT 2012 OCT 2012 NOV 2012 DEC 2012 3 Pathology Innovations | Clinical | Translational A Laboratory-Based Genetics Counselor We employed a genetics counselor who works diligently on pre-analytic and post-analytic testing issues. She is available for consultations to assist providers in the selection of the appropriate test, screens molecular genetic send-out tests for appropriateness, and interfaces with clinicians when needed. She intervened in 158 test orders in fiscal year 2012-13 that resulted in a cost avoidance of $456,431. The Future We are currently assessing the impact of other implemented initiatives, such as Smart Alerts for the regional hospitals and Expensive Test Notifications, both of which are performing well. We are building an “extended hard stop” CDST, which will extend the time period during which a duplicate test will not be allowed. These and other projects will occupy the time of the Test Utilization Committee at Cleveland Clinic in the near future, as we continually strive to improve patient care and prepare for the challenges of health care reform. Conclusion The Test Utilization Committee has raised the bar in asking for a quality assessment, “is this test really needed?” Most importantly, we believe we have improved the patient experience, decreased unnecessary phlebotomy for the commonly used tests, improved the use of molecular genetic tests, and decreased healthcare costs. The total annual savings for these initiatives in fiscal year 2012/2013 was $1,362,940. Importantly, our initiatives never interrupted patient care and we would argue has improved it. The entire process has been an enjoyable lesson in team building and enhancing practice within the our healthcare system. About the Author Gary W.

Lacbawan, MD, FCAP, FACMG “Genome: Unlocking Life’s Code,” the Smithsonian’s National Museum of Natural History and National Institutes of Health’s National Human Genome Research Institute exhibit, describes in a nutshell what laboratories like ours contribute to patient care. The Molecular Genetics Pathology (MGP) Laboratory, a section of the Department of Molecular Pathology, is responsive to the clinical molecular diagnostic needs of genetic-based medicine at Cleveland Clinic and the community. Our laboratory strives to provide molecular tests for a full range of indications spanning inherited and genetic disorders to pharmacogenomics including preventive, diagnostic, prognostic, therapeutic or predictive drug (safety and efficacy) use. In most instances, in-house assays are developed and validated and testing methodologies are improved for clinical use. Our efforts are threefold, we continue to develop tests that are relevant to clinical practice, assist practitioners in molecular test utilization and educate health professionals and the community about the right molecular test used in patient diagnosis, treatment and anticipatory care. Test Development In addition to standard-of-care tests, the MGP laboratory actively promotes translational research and seeks opportunities to collaborate with clinical and research experts in areas of interest. Tests to be in-sourced and developed are prioritized drawing from consultative meetings with clinical specialists, current test utilization patterns in the Clinic, and the commercial availability of DNA/RNA-based clinical laboratory tests. For each molecular test, considerations include clinical utility, ease of test adoption and test validation. In addition to offering tests for more common genetic disorders, the MGP laboratory recognizes the value of developing tests for select rare conditions for which testing is not widely available. Bringing molecular tests in-house not only facilitates access to laboratory experts but translates to significant cost savings from test send-outs, shorter turn-around time and potentially more timely diagnosis and treatment for reduced length of hospital stay and decreased disease morbidity. In recent years we have witnessed the trajectory of the increasing number and complexity of genetic and genomic tests made available to clinicians and patients. Single gene testing for Mendelian disorders has evolved to gene panel testing. The debut of whole exome sequencing for diagnosis of cases with likely genetic etiology holds considerable promise. The MGP laboratory is positioned to parallel the said trajectory, albeit in a carefully planned and responsible manner. As we actively roll out a number of single gene laboratory tests (LDTs) in the coming months, next-generation (massive parallel) sequencing for multiple genes in a panel will follow. We hope to sustain growth and build capacity, as it is our goal to offer whole exome sequencing in-house in the future. Test Utilization The MGP laboratory promotes and supports proper utilization of nucleic acid-based tests in the molecular diagnosis of specific disorders in patients from various specialties of medicine. Ordering the right test to confirm patient diagnosis, to predict the risk, to determine the prognosis, and to optimize drug therapy is an integral part of clinical practice. MGP has an active role in defining best clinical practice. Genetic test review is performed daily for all molecular test send-outs. Test indications are verified by the laboratory genetic counselor. For more complex tests, as in gene panels, review of the electronic medical record is done to assess the appropriateness of the test with the collaboration of the ordering clinician. Review by clinical geneticist/molecular genetic pathologist staff in the laboratory provides guidance on how best to pursue molecular diagnostic testing. Depending on the clinical presentation and the type and frequency of mutations in the gene(s) 5 Pathology Innovations | Clinical | Translational for the disorder being considered, tiered testing may be recommended. Monthly assessment of molecular test send-outs captures a complete picture of molecular test utilization that will guide the laboratory on future test development. Moreover, MGP helped develop the system and infrastructure that integrates pharmacogenetic testing into clinical practice for the Personalized Medication Program led by the Center for Personalized Health as a new enterprise-wide initiative. MGP will continue to collaborate with Centers of Excellence or specialty clinics like the Clinic for Adult Autoinflammatory Disorders of the Orthopaedic & Rheumatologic Institute. A team of laboratory and clinical experts aim to develop acceptable evidence-based algorithms for disease-related gene testing. Efforts to streamline and standardize test ordering and utilization (see related story, “The Right Test,” on page 2), and patient consenting are actively being pursued. The logistics of DNA extraction, storage, retrieval and reporting are currently in place to support future initiatives related to tier-testing and next-generation sequencing. Education The MGP laboratory participates in the training and education of students, residents, fellows and house staff to promote proper utilization and interpretation of molecular tests. The new ACGME-accredited Fellowship Program in Molecular Genetic Pathology was granted three-year accreditation. The inaugural fellow joined the department in July 2013. The program will be an overarching, well-rounded fellowship training that covers the fundamentals of human genetics, cytogenetics, molecular hematopathology, molecular oncology as well as molecular microbiology. It emphasizes integrative and evidence-based Molecular Genetic Pathology practice with laboratory management as an integral part of every rotation. With well-qualified faculty members who are authorities in various subspecialties of pathology and genetics, the program will ultimately graduate fellows who will assume a key role in a world-class clinical laboratory that offers molecular diagnostic testing. As clinical laboratories employ massive parallel sequencing and variants of unknown significance (VUS) continue to mount, so is the demand for appropriately trained molecular genetics professionals. They will serve as an interface between the test performing laboratories and the clinicians in the interpretation of test results, especially given the ease of access to online information by patients. They will advance the critical role of the molecular genetic pathologist as a health team member catering to an integrated approach of care for patients. Of the possible 25,000 genes that make up the human genome, more than half (14,361 genes) have been described in the Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man. Though only 3,888 defined phenotypes have molecular bases (as of September 10, 2013), increasing number of disorders are becoming well delineated and mutations or variants in their associated genes may have implications for diagnosis, prognosis, therapeutics/drug therapy stratification or risk assessment. There is no doubt that more genetic and genomic tests, if not whole exome or genome sequencing, will become an integral part of everyday health care. Confounded by the limited time health providers have for each patient, mustering and mastering the different genetic conditions and tests made clinically available becomes a daunting task. Add to this the costs of molecular testing, the increasing complexity and highly technical methodology used in testing, the best definitive diagnostic test for the patient can only be realized by effective communication and close collaboration of the clinician and the laboratory. These are the best answers to the growing demands for responsible genetic testing in the belt-tightening economic realities for health care. So, when your clinic schedule is too tight and there is less time to dive deeper into the current literature on a genetic or genomic test, you can count on the MGP laboratory to help you arrive at the right test for your patient. 6 Fall Fall|| 2013 Informed Consent for Genetic Testing, Genetic Test Ordering and Test Result Interpretation As we bring molecular tests in-house, we are reminded of the foremost participants in every genetic test being ordered – the patient and his or her family. As health professionals serving well-informed, internet-savvy patients, it is our responsibility to be able to provide acceptable explanations of the genetic or genomic tests we order on behalf of the patient. The genome carries the blueprint of who we are – from the color of our eyes to the dosage of a drug we should take. The Human Genome Project has resulted in an explosion in the number of complex, DNA-based tests. The fast-paced discovery of disease-causing mutations in genes is allowing us to catch up with new medical knowledge. With the many specialists that one visits in order to arrive at a diagnosis, each specialist may order genetic tests relevant to a patient’s clinical manifestation before referring the patient to a clinical geneticist. Perhaps you have recently ordered a genetic test. You may have come across the name of the gene in your readings or at a national meeting or conference, so you decided to check it on your patients. Before ordering the genetic test for a patient, you may want to address the following: • Is the clinical manifestation(s) of your patient compatible with a phenotype of a specific genotype or does it mimic of the interaction of environmental factors with a normal genotype (phenocopy)? • Do you know if there is a single gene or a number of genes associated with your patient’s clinical manifestation(s) (genetic heterogeneity)? • Is there a good genotype-to-phenotype correlation in the disorder being tested? Is the detection rate better if a panel of genes is pursued instead? • If there are several or a number of genes involved, will tier-testing for the deleterious mutations or variants in the most common gene(s) be appropriate? Since you are convinced that the likelihood of a positive test result is high, your have decided to order the specific genetic test. As you set out to place the order, you are asked to consent your patient for the test. You may think a genetic informed consent for testing is just added paperwork on top of the pile of things to do in the documentation of the patient’s visit. But before you question the need for a genetic consent, you need to understand the reasons why it may be important. The information contained in a genetic test report may reveal a diagnosis that may exist in the family. Results may predict future health risks for progressive genetic conditions for which there is no cure. There may be direct implications for the health of a patient’s family members, including parents, siblings and children. Parents may need to be tested for confirmation. In the process, unexpected unknown biological relationships like non-paternity, parental consanguinity or undisclosed adoption status may be revealed. At this stage, it is best to clarify with the patient what the genetic test is, why it is being done, the possible outcome(s), and limitations of the test. Take this opportunity to gauge the patient’s expectations of the test and address any concern that the patient may have about the genetic test. After proper patient consent, the patient sample is sent to the laboratory for a specific genetic test. A couple weeks later, the result becomes available and your patient sees you in your clinic. You review the test results carefully and it indicates no mutation or variant was detected. • Would you be able to explain the negative result to your patient? • Are you familiar with the methodology the laboratory used for the test? • Are the limitations of the test specified and do you understand them? • Will the test detect all types of mutation or variant for the gene or the panel of genes you are interested in? • Are there any guidance and/or recommendations provided in the test result report? • Are there other appropriate test methodologies that are being used for the same gene or gene panel? • Are you going to pursue another genetic test? Before answering the last question, or at any stage in the genetic testing process, it may be best to seek collaborators. A clinical geneticist and a molecular genetic pathologist are expert resources who have the same goal as everyone in the health care team – an integrated and comprehensive diagnostic work-up to ensure value-based care for every patient. Next time, you can ask our MGP laboratory to serve as your expert resource for a genetic test review. 7 Pathology Innovations | Clinical | Translational About the Author Felicitas L.

Chromosomal microarray analysis (CMA) is a recommended first-tier test for diagnosing unexplained intellectual disabilities, dysmorphic features, congenital anomalies and autism.1-5 This technique compares relative fluorescent signal intensities of two different genomes, a test and a reference, that compete for hybridization to DNA sequences representing the whole human genome in order to detect a gain or loss of genetic material. However, CMA does not detect allelic imbalances resulting in absence of heterozygosity (AOH). Advances in the field of genetics and diagnostic medicine have resulted in refinement of the existing CMA platform by incorporating single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers to the existing non-polymorphic markers used to detect gains and losses of DNA. The analysis of SNP data provides information about the allelic imbalances associated with AOH. Identifying regions of excessive homozygosity on a single chromosome could suggest uniparental disomy (UPD), which may warrant further clinical and laboratory investigation when observed on chromosomes with known imprinting disorders associated with UPD. In addition, the detection of excessive homozygosity on multiple chromosomes may suggest consanguinity and, therefore, could be useful in determining candidate genes for further testing for autosomal recessive disorders. At Cleveland Clinic Laboratories we use Agilent technology comprised of 107,000 oligonucleotide 60mer probes spaced one probe every 40kb across the backbone of the array and one probe every 10kb in targeted clinically significant regions in the genome. For SNP analysis, the array features 60,000 SNP 60mer probes with an effective resolution down to 10Mb. Data for the SNP markers are displayed to demonstrate either homozygosity (AA or BB) or heterozygosity (AB) at every SNP locus. AOH is indicative of hemizygosity if the corresponding CMA data shows a deletion of the region. If the CMA data is normal, AOH signifies homozygosity. Many abnormal phenotypes in the pediatric population are associated with chromosomal imbalances that can be identified using CMA to detect copy number change (CNC). Thus, whole-genome CMA has replaced chromosome and FISH studies to become the first-tier test for the evaluation of children with unexplained developmental disabilities, intellectual disabilities, dysmorphic features, congenital anomalies and autism. Based on numerous published studies, the yield of pathogenic or clinically significant CNC by CMA is approximately 15-20% in a pediatric population, compared with a yield of 3-5% by standard cytogenetic analysis in the same population. Variants of uncertain clinical significance (VOUS), or clinical significance unknown, are found in less than 10% and could play an important role in the clinical diagnosis. To a great extent, parental and family studies can be helpful in the clinical interpretation of these unknowns, as de novo occurrence of the CNC is more likely related to a pathogenic event. CMA testing for CNC is recommended as a first-line test in the initial postnatal evaluation of individuals with the following: • multiple anomalies not specific to a well-delineated genetic syndrome • apparently nonsyndromic DD/ID • autism spectrum disorders This is not a recommended test for adult patients with multiple miscarriages or pregnancy losses and no abnormal phenotype. Chromosome analysis is a better test to exclude possibility of balanced rearrangements that cause pregnancy losses. Appropriate follow-up is recommended in cases of chromosome imbalance identified by CMA and may include cytogenetic/ FISH or other molecular studies of the patient or parents, and clinical genetics consultation. In addition to detecting CNC, the SNP microarray can also be used to diagnose suspected uniparental disomy (UPD) or imprinting disorder, possible absence of heterozygosity to determine the degree of relatedness by identity-by-descent (autozygosity) and autosomal recessive condition risks. 9 Pathology Innovations | Clinical | Translational Additional testing may be necessary to confirm disorders associated with absence of heterozygosity. SNP testing may be used to identify: • a chromosomal abnormality or micro-duplication/deletion syndrome with a normal karyotype • the size of a duplication/deletion involved in an unbalanced translocation • triploidy • cryptic duplications/deletions in a phenotypically abnormal individual with an apparently balanced karyotype. • uniparental disomy (UPD) • absence of heterozygosity to determine the degree of relatedness by identity-by-descent (autozygosity) The SNP test involves DNA extraction, restriction enzyme digestion, labeling, purification, hybridization, washing, array scanning, analysis and interpretation. DNA extracted from the patient’s peripheral blood is digested, labeled and hybridized to the microarray. Following hybridization, the microarray is scanned, and the signal intensities are collected and then compared to a reference in order to determine copy number changes and absence of heterozygosity. Whole genome SNP microarray testing at Cleveland Clinic utilizes the GGXChip + SNP v1.0 platform, which contains non-polymorphic and polymorphic probes to detect both copy number changes (CNC) and allelic imbalances (SNP probes) within the same array. For CNC analysis, the array is comprised of 107,000 oligonucleotide 60mer probes spaced one probe every 40kb across the backbone of the array and one probe every 10kb in targeted clinically significant regions in the genome. For SNP analysis, the array features 60,000 SNP 60mer probes with an effective resolution down to 10Mb. In the backbone regions the resolution for copy number detection is approximately 120kb and in the targeted regions it is approximately 30kb. In our validation the resolution for AOH was detected at approximately 1.5Mb, but resolution is dependent on SNP probe coverage. For clinical purposes, AOH greater than 10Mb will be reported; however, in chromosomes associated with imprinting disorders,smaller changes will be evaluated further and may be reported. For a complete list of clinically recognized regions of the genome and imprinted chromosomes please visit www.signaturegenomics.com.6 There are some limitations to this platform. For example, it is not optimized to detect low-level mosaicism and uniparental disomy of the heterodisomy type. It will not detect balanced alterations (reciprocal translocations, Robertsonian translocations, inversions and balanced insertions), point mutations or imbalances of regions not represented on the microarray. Interpretation Gains and losses are reported based on genomic content in line with ACMG guidelines for microarray interpretation. Copy number variations (CNV) or CNC devoid of relevant gene content or reported as common findings in the general population may not be reported. A copy number change of uncertain clinical significance may be detected and will be reported per ACMG guidelines in one of three subcategories: uncertain clinical significance, likely pathogenic; uncertain clinical significance, likely benign; or uncertain clinical significance, no classification. While most copy number changes observed by chromosomal microarray testing can readily be characterized as pathogenic or benign, there are limited data available to support definitive classification of a subset into either of these categories. In these situations, a number of considerations are taken into account to help interpret results including the size and gene content of the imbalance, whether the change is a deletion or duplication, the inheritance pattern, and the clinical and/or developmental history of a transmitting parent. The continual discovery of novel copy number variations and published clinical reports means that the interpretation of any given copy number change may evolve with increased scientific understanding. The detection of excessive homozygosity may suggest the need for additional laboratory testing to confirm uniparental disomy or to test for mutations in genes associated with autosomal recessive disorders consistent with the patient’s clinical presentation that are present in regions of homozygosity. 10 Fall | 2013 Figure 1. Uniparental disomy 15 A: CMA Data, Agilent Array B: SNP Data, Agilent Array CGH showed normal copy number (1a); however AOH was noted for chromosome 15 (UPD15) (1b) and was confirmed by methylation studies. This patient has been diagnosed with Angelman syndrome. Uniparental disomy: Uniparental disomy (UPD), the presence of two copies of a chromosome or chromosomal region from a single parent, is clinically relevant when it involves loci that undergo genomic imprinting. There are two types of UPD: isodisomy, in which the two parental copies are identical; and heterodisomy, in which the parental copies are derived from both parental homologs and are therefore not identical. SNP microarrays will detect isodisomy but not heterodisomy, since only isodisomy or segmental isodisomy results in homozygosity. UPD is the most likely explanation for an absence of heterozygosity that is restricted to a single chromosome, especially if the region is very large. Several chromosome regions are imprinted and lead to an abnormal phenotype in the presence of UPD derived from a particular parent (Figure 1). UPD in other regions of the genome, even if covering a large region, is generally not considered to be a pathogenic finding in and of itself (see recessive disease discussion below). Identity by Descent (IBD) and Consanguinity: The observation of multiple AOH regions, also known as long continuous stretches of homozygosity (LCSH), present on multiple chromosomes is generally assumed to reflect inheritance of these regions by descent from a common ancestor. This type of homozygosity is referred to as “identity by descent.” A single or a few small isolated stretches can be the result of a founder effect in an isolated population. Presence of especially long stretches on multiple chromosomes suggests the possibility of a more direct biological relationship between the parents (i.e., parental consanguinity) (Figure 2). A consanguineous relationship refers to the sharing of a common ancestor and the term consanguinity is generally used when individuals are second cousins or closer. However, there are other explanations for a relatively high level of identity by descent. For example, a high overall level of homozygosity can result from unusual recombination or segregation patterns during meiosis. It may also be observed for a distantly related couple who have multiple common ancestors. The latter circumstance may occur, for example, in individuals from an isolated population that arose recently from a small founding group or in populations where cousin marriages are common. For the above reasons, the SNP data themselves are not diagnostic of a specific degree of parental relatedness.7-8 Therefore, SNP data must be interpreted in the context of additional family and social history information and the clinician must determine whether it is appropriate to pursue the question of parental consanguinity for individual families. 11 Pathology Innovations | Clinical | Translational Figure 2. Parental Consanguinity Full Genome Profile Chromosome 1 Chromosome 11 Chromosome 2 Chromosome 13 Chromosome 3 Chromosome 14 Chromosome 4 Chromosome 16 Chromosome 5 Chromosome 17 Chromosome 6 Chromosome 18 Chromosome 7 Chromosome 21 Chromosome 8 Chromosome 9 Multiple AOH regions were identified, consistent with parental relatedness OR identity by descent. 12 Chromosome 10 Chromosome 22 Fall Fall|| 2013 Autosomal recessive disease risk: Regardless of whether AOH results from uniparental disomy (UPD) or identity by descent, homozygosity anywhere in the genome raises the possibility of recessive conditions. Our reports alert the physician to the increased possibility of these conditions for regions of homozygosity greater than 10Mb. The referring physician can use this information in conjunction with clinical features and family history to determine whether mutation testing of individual genes is warranted. Triploidy: Triploidy can be seen prenatally and appears at an appreciable frequency in miscarriages, but it is extremely rare postnatally. The three types of triploidy are 69,XXX; 69,XXY; and 69,XYY. With aCGH, 69,XXY and 69,XYY triploidy can be detected, but not 69,XXX. The SNP Microarray allows for the detection of all types of triploidy due to the capability of detecting four genotypes (AAA, AAB, ABB, and BBB) rather than the normal three genotypes (AA, AB, and BB). Genetic Counseling: A referral to a clinical genetics professional is often appropriate for individuals and families undergoing whole genome microarray testing. This may be valuable both before and after testing. Families should be aware of the possibility of a result of uncertain clinical significance and the need for parental blood samples to help interpret the change. Families should also understand that findings of AOH may require additional testing of the proband before a diagnosis can be made. Clinical geneticists can guide testing strategies and further evaluate the patient in light of the test results. In some cases it may be important to discuss the potential for discovery of parental consanguinity. Genetic counseling can also elicit a thorough family and social history, which can be critical in the interpretation of the SNP array results. The failure to detect evidence of uniparental disomy does not exclude the clinical diagnosis of an imprinting-associated disorder. UPD may be of the heterodisomy type, which is not detected by the array, and mechanisms other than UPD can cause the disorder.9 Similar to the copy number-only CMA, the CMA copy number + SNP cannot detect balanced rearrangements and may not be capable of detecting low-level mosaicism. It also does not detect point mutations, small deletions or insertions below the resolution of the assay, or other types of mutations such as epigenetic changes. Finally, test results are sometimes of uncertain clinical significance, and studies of additional family members may be required to assist with interpretation. References 1. Miller DT et al.

Valeria Arrossi, MD, and Carol Farver, MD Major advances in the understanding of the biology of lung non-small cell carcinomas (NSCLC) in the last decade opened the door to individualized therapeutic options for patients with lung cancer. In particular, the discovery of two targetable genetic alterations, the presence of mutations in the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene and translocation of the ALK gene, conveyed a tremendous change in the managing of patients with lung cancer. EGFR mutations are strong predictors of efficacy for treatment with inhibitors of the EGFR tyrosine kinase (EGFR-TKI), erlotinib and gefitinib. Clinical trials including patients with advanced EGFR mutant tumors have demonstrated longer progression-free survival when treated with EGFR-TKI therapy compared to those treated with standard chemotherapy.1-3 In addition, response rate and outcomes are decreased in patients with EGFR wild-type tumors treated with EGFR TKIs. In general, these recommendations include three major changes. First, bronchioloalveolar cell carcinoma (BAC) is a confusing term that has gone through various interpretations and pathologic definitions over the past 20 years. Thus, a new term, lepidic growth pattern, has been recommended to replace BAC. Second, several studies have shown that patients with small adenocarcinomas (less than 2 to 3.0 cm) with pure lepidic growth pattern or adenocarcinomas with focal non-lepidic growth pattern have 100% survival and near 100% survival at five years, respectively, if entirely resected.6-8 These observations led to changes in the classification of these lepidic growth predominant adenocarcinomas, formerly known as “BAC” in resection specimens as follows14: • A tumor less than 3.0 cm and shows pure lepidic growth pattern is referred to as adenocarcinoma in situ (AIS). Similarly, the presence of the translocation of the anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) gene resulting in the creation of the equinoderm microtubule associated protein-like 4 (EML4)-ALK fusion transcript in lung adenocarcinomas resulted in greater response rates and progression-free survival when treated with the ALK inhibitor crizotinib.4-5 Finally, several clinicopathologic studies of adenocarcinomas have demonstrated that the presence and amount of certain histologic growth patterns are associated with overall outcomes.6-8 • A tumor that is less than 3.0 cm and shows non-lepidic growth pattern of no more than 5 mm is referred to as minimally invasive adenocarcinoma (MIA). To reflect these advances, discoveries and observations regarding lung NSCLC, a new international multidisciplinary classification of adenocarcinomas has been published as a joint effort by the International Association for the Study in Lung Cancer (IASLC), the American Thoracic Society (ATS) and European Respiratory Society (ERS)9, followed by the publications of clinical guidelines for the diagnosis of adenocarcinoma in resection specimens and small specimens by the College of American Pathologists (CAP), IASLC and Association for Molecular Pathology (AMP).10-11 Guidelines for the molecular diagnosis of NSCLC were independently published by the CAP and incorporated into the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines.12-13 Important implications of this new classification affect staging and revision of the terminology used by pathologists in small specimens or cytology. The identification of a preinvasive category for adenocarcinomas in the lung, similar to in situ carcinomas (squamous cell carcinoma or adenocarcinoma) of other organs, mandates additional pathologic T stages of TIS and TMIA. Also, the presence of AIS may suggest tumor synchronicity if seen in multiple tumors in the lung, as opposed to intrapulmonary metastatic lesions. Finally, since the diagnosis of AIS and MIA can only be made after histologic evaluation of the entire tumor, these terms should not be used in biopsies or small specimens. Adenocarcinoma with lepidic growth is the preferred term in these samples to reflect the possibility of a non-lepidic pattern of adenocarcinoma in the not-sampled tumor. 2 • If a non-lepidic growth pattern is present in an area of over 5 mm, (e.g. acinar, papillary, solid, etc) the tumor is referred to as an invasive adenocarcinoma. AIS, MIA and invasive adenocarcinomas may be non-mucinous or mucinous, depending on cytological characteristics. Differentiation of adenocarcinoma versus squamous cell carcinoma is currently crucial for case selection for molecular testing of predictor biomarkers and therapy options, as pemetrexed, an anti-folate agent, and bevacizumab, a VEGF antibody, are only indicated in tumors with “non-squamous” histology. In addition, activating EGFR mutation and EML-ALK translocations are almost always present in NSCLC other than pure squamous cell carcinoma and are predictive of response to EGFR TKIs and ALK TKIs, respectively. Therefore, providing more detailed information in those tumors that otherwise were formerly diagnosed as NSCLC in small biopsy or cytology specimens becomes an important step in the evaluation of biopsies/cytology with lung cancer. Tumors that have no morphologic evidence of squamous or adenocarcinoma differentiation should be further classified, in small specimens, based on IHC studies so that appropriate molecular testing is performed. However, given the small size of these specimens, IHC and histochemical work up should be limited to as few stains as possible to avoid tissue waste. These IHC panels include an adenocarcinoma marker (TTF-1, and/or Napsin-A) and a squamous cell carcinoma marker (p63, and/or p40).15-16 Additional stains may be used for undetermined or equivocal cases with the 2-marker panel. Mucin stains may help to find intra-cytoplasmic mucin. NSCLC, NOS should be reserved for those cases where the NSCLCs has no definitive morphologic evidence of adenocarcinoma or squamous carcinoma, and either histochemistry and/or IHC show equivocal stain patterns, or the biopsy contains scant tissue for evaluation. Spring | 2014 • Clinical parameters should not be used for case-selection for molecular testing except in rare exceptions such as in young patients, never-smokers with biopsies demonstrating squamous cell carcinoma or small cell carcinoma. • Molecular results should be available in no more than two weeks. One of the most important implications that result from the new classification and guidelines resides in the approach to care of patients with lung cancer. The evaluation, diagnosis and treatment of patients with NSCLC should be based, nowadays, on the integration and intercommunication of a multidisciplinary team that includes pulmonologists, radio/ oncologists, surgeons, radiologists and pathologists. The decision regarding the optimal approach to obtaining and processing diagnostic procedures that will provide specimens with adequate tumor tissue and/or cellularity for the appropriate and expeditious pathologic and molecular evaluations should be the result of discussions among the members of the multidisciplinary team. Similarly, the algorithms of molecular testing should be determined by the multidisciplinary team of each institution. • Adenocarcinoma In summary, in resection specimens, adenocarcinomas with lepidic growth pattern should be separated into AIS, MIA or invasive adenocarcinoma based on size and lepidic growth pattern content. The distinction between histologic types of NSCLC in patients with lung cancer is critical for the selection of molecular testing and therapy choices in patients with NSCLC. Pathologic evaluation of lung cancer specimens is not always limited to morphologic evaluation, since limited ancillary stains, if appropriate, and eventual molecular testing, should be applied for proper patient care.

Tubbs, DO, and Michael J. McNamara, MD Cancers of the lung are aggressive diseases, accounting for approximately 30% of all cancer deaths in the United States in 2009, with the overall survival rate of patients with metastatic disease less than 15%.1 Different histological subtypes exist; Small-Cell Lung Cancer (SCLC), which accounts for approximately 20% of lung cancer cases, and Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC), which accounts for the majority of lung cancer cases in the United States. NSCLC includes adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma and large-cell carcinoma. NSCLC tumors are also categorized according to molecular criteria. EGFR(epidermal growth factor receptor) mutant NSCLC has been defined as a distinct, clinically relevant subset of lung cancer. EGFR-mutant tumors are histologically similar to adenocarcinomas, and are often associated with better prognosis than EGFR wild-type tumors, due in the most part to their increased sensitivity to Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors (TKIs) such as erlotinib (Tarceva; Genentech/OSI Pharmaceuticals) or gefitinib (Iressa; AstraZeneca). However, not all mutations in the EGFR gene confer sensitivity to TKIs, and primary resistance is still observed. In addition to this, acquired resistance can develop after prolonged TKI exposure, which limits the effectiveness of this type of treatment. EGFR is a transmembrane receptor belonging to the ERBB family of receptor tyrosine kinases, which also includes HER2, HER3 and HER4. After ligand binding, the EGFR receptor forms a dimer that activates receptor autophosphorylation through tyrosine kinase activity, which triggers a series of intracellular pathways that may result in cancer-cell proliferation, blocking apoptosis, activating invasion and metastasis, and stimulating tumor-induced neovascularization.2,6 Small-molecule EGFR TKIs inhibit EGFR autophosphorylation and downstream signaling by reversibly competing with ATP to bind to the intracellular catalytic domain of EGFR tyrosine kinase.2 Activating mutations in EGFR occur in exons 18 to 21, which encode the kinase domain. These mutations are usually heterozygous, and amplification of the mutant allele can also occur.1 The most common activating mutations found in EGFR are deletions in exon 19 centered around four amino acids (LREA) at positions 747 – 750, and a missense mutation (L858R) arising as a result of the leucine to arginine amino 6 acid substitution at position 858 within exon 21. Together, these account for approximately 90% of TKI-sensitive mutations within the EGFR-mutant tumors.1,7 The L861Q mutation in exon 21 and the substitution of glycine at position 719 in exon 18 with alanine (G719A), serine (G719S) or cysteine (G719C) also confer increased sensitivity to EGFR TKIs,7,8 although these are much less common. Together, the activating mutations discussed above are associated with response rates of approximately 70% when treated with erlotinib or gefitinib.9 Analysis of the crystal structures of L858R and G719S EGFR mutants has demonstrated that the kinase is activated through disruption of autoinhibitory interactions, resulting in receptors with 50-fold more activity compared to wild-type EGFR receptors.1 Recent studies have shown that patients with tumors harboring exon 19 deletions are associated with longer time to progression (TTP) and overall survival (OS) when compared with L858R point mutations,9 presumably due to greater sensitivity to TKI treatments. Mutations in exons 18 to 21 can also be associated with decreased sensitivity/primary resistance to TKIs. Small insertions or duplications in exon 20 (including D770_ N771insG) have been shown to be less sensitive to TKIs than exon 19 deletion and L858R mutants. In fact, most patients with these mutations show progressive disease while undergoing TKI therapy.1 Acquired resistance can also arise, and despite an initial response to EGFR TKI therapy, patients with EGFR mutations rarely achieve a complete radiographic or pathologic response. Prolonged TKI treatment provides a selective pressure for the development of tumor cells with acquired resistance to gefitinib or erlotinib.8 The T790M mutation which arises as a result of the substitution of threonine to methionine at position 790 in exon 20 has been found in 50% of patients with EGFR-mutant tumors who develop acquired resistance to TKIs.1,3,4,8 This phenomenon is also seen in chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) cells harboring ABL translocations and gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) cells harboring activating KIT mutations, whereby the threonine gatekeeper residues are substituted with bulkier isoleucine residues that alter drug binding in both ABL (T315I) and KIT (T670I).1 The T790M mutation is rare, occurring in <5% of untreated Spring | 2014 EGFR mutant tumors, but is detected as a second site mutation in half of patients who develop acquired resistance to EGFR TKI therapy.1 Evidence exists to show that acquired resistance can be lost after a period without TKI therapy,1,5 however the mechanisms involved in this are not yet fully understood, and a recommendation regarding discontinuation of EGFR TKI therapy after developing acquired resistance has not yet been made. The Qiagen EGFR RGQ PCR assay uses Scorpions and ARMS® technologies to detect the following 29 somatic mutations (full details in Table 1) against a background of wild-type genomic DNA: Numerous studies and trials have been conducted emphasizing the importance of using genomic assessments of EGFR rather than using clinical characteristics, as the former is more accurate in selecting a group of patients with increased chance of sensitivity to EGFR-TKI therapy.9 • L861Q • 19 deletions in exon 19 (detects the presence of any of the 19 deletions, but does not distinguish between them) • T790M • L858R • G719X (detects the presence of any of Q719S, G719A or G719C, but does not distinguish between them) • S768I • 3 insertions in exon 20 (detects the presence of any of 3 insertions but does not distinguish between them).

Taq DNA polymerase is effective at distinguishing between a match and a mismatch at the 3’ end of a PCR primer. Specific mutated sequences are selectively amplified, even in samples where the majority of the sequences do not carry the mutation. When the primer is fully matched, the amplification proceeds with full efficiency. When the 3’ base is mismatched, only low level background amplification occurs.10 Scorpions, or bi-functional molecules containing a PCR primer covalently linked to a probe, are used to detect amplification. The fluorophore in this probe interacts with a quencher, also incorporated into the probe, which reduces fluorescence. During PCR, when the probe binds to the amplicon, the fluorophore and quencher become separated. This leads to an increase in fluorescence from the reaction tube.10 A total of seven mutation reactions, each labeled with FAM are performed. Each mutation reaction contains Scorpion probes plus primers for discrimination between the wild-type DNA and mutant DNA detected by real time PCR. A control reaction (a region of exon 2 for which the primers and probe have been designed to avoid any known EGFR polymorphisms), also labeled in FAM, is performed to assess the amount of amplifiable DNA in the sample and to calculate the difference in cycle threshold (ΔCT) between the mutation reaction and the control reaction from the same sample. A sample is considered mutation positive if the ΔCT is less than the cut-off ΔCT for that mutation reaction. Above this value, the sample may either contain less than the percentage of mutant DNA detectable by the assay, or the sample does not contain that specific mutation. The assay is capable of detecting mutations in samples containing at least 10% mutant allele. This is representative of 20% tumor within a heterogeneous sample containing tumor and non-tumor cells. When using ARMS primers, some inefficient priming may occur, giving a very late background CT from DNA not containing a mutation. All CT values calculated from background amplification will be greater than the cut-off ΔCT values and the samples will be classed as mutation negative.10 This is particularly noticeable in the T790M mutation reaction, due to the fact that the T790M mutation is found in a very GC rich region. With primer design, GC content is critical for PCR efficiency. The sensitivity of the T790M assay 8 is affected due to an increased limit of blank (LOB), which only allows an increased % of mutant to be discriminately detected. In the assay, this reflects itself in a lower ΔCT cut-off, and the potential for ‘breakthrough’ (non-specific) amplification late in the reaction. References 1. Pao & Chmielecki.

Tubbs, DO, and Jordan P. Reynolds, MD Lung cancer is the second most common malignancy overall in the United States and despite improved detection and treatment, remains the leading cause of cancer-related death in men and women worldwide.1 Lung cancers have been classically divided into small cell and non-small cell types based on morphology and clinical features. With recent advances in molecular pathogenesis and the discovery of specific targetable genetic alterations in certain lung carcinomas, this division has become essential for therapeutic management. Non–small cell lung carcinomas (NSCLC) represent approximately 80% of lung cancers and are further classified into adenocarcinoma (40%-50%), squamous cell carcinoma (30%) and large cell carcinoma (9%). A subset of NSCLC, mostly adenocarcinomas, exhibit mutations of epidermal growth factor receptors (EGFR) that confer sensitivity to tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Targeted therapies with such inhibitors have been shown to improve the otherwise dismal survival in patients with tumors harboring EGFR activating mutations.2 The anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) gene encodes a receptor tyrosine kinase that is normally not expressed in lung cells. Approximately 5% of NSCLC harbor ALK gene rearrangements, most commonly in the form of a small intrachromosomal inversion, inv(2)(p21;p23), with the fusion of ALK with echinoderm microtubule associated protein like 4 (EML4) gene.3 The ALK/EML4 fusion produces an abnormal, constitutively active chimeric protein kinase with oncogenic properties.4,5 Targeted ALK tyrosine kinase inhibitors have proven anticancer activity, with crizotinib showing a good clinical response in advanced NSCLC patients harboring ALK rearrangements.6 While relatively uncommon in NSCLC, the presence of ALK rearrangements has major therapeutic implications, and thus needs to be assessed through an accurate, reproducible and accessible diagnostic test. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved an in-vitro diagnostic class fluorescence in-situ hybridization (FISH) test as a companion diagnostic tool for crizotinib-based treatment eligibility [Abbott Molecular Vysis (AMV)]. As a consequence, FISH is currently considered the gold standard for ALK-status testing and it can be performed on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) material. The commercial break-apart FISH format consists of red and green probes that flank the highly conserved translocation breakpoint within the ALK gene. Normal cells exhibit yellow fusion signals while neoplastic cells harboring ALK rearrangements show split red and green signals. A case is interpreted as ALK-positive by FISH when 15% or more tumor cell nuclei demonstrate isolated green and red or isolated red signals among 50 tumor nuclei scored.7 With the current emphasis on minimally invasive diagnostic procedures, testing for ALK rearrangements by FISH is increasingly attempted on small specimens, including biopsies or FFPE-cytoblocks prepared from fine needle biopsy (FNA) samples. In certain cases, like those of patients with late-stage disease, small FNA specimens may be the only material available, as these patients are not eligible for surgery. At our institution, the ThinPrep liquid based cytology platform (Hologic, Bedford, MA) is preferred for processing lung FNA specimens due to several advantages including: minimal artifacts, air-drying, lack of smear-crushing and homogenous cell enrichment with nearly 100% cell transfer to slide.8 The protocol involves generation of a cell pellet from the FNA sample collected in CytoLyt, which is then divided for the preparation of a ThinPrep slide used for diagnosis and of a cytoblock used for molecular testing.9 The material obtained from an FNA procedure may not be sufficient for FFPEcytoblock preparation and further molecular testing. Even more frequently in our experience, a significant proportion of Table 1. Breakdown of available and informative NSCLC samples by type and test. 10 Sample Type Total Available Informative by ThinPrep-FISH Informative by IHC ThinPrep 230 228 N/A Cytoblock 211 N/A 154 Informative by ThinPrep-FISH and IHC 154 Spring | 2014 Table 2.

This issue has also been reported by other laboratories10 and has been attributed to the inherent variability in the cytoblock preparation process which involves human handling. Inadequacy of cytoblocks for molecular testing is a problematic issue that can lead to treatment delays in a subset of cases and result in repeat procedures necessary to obtain additional material. A C Our study of 230 FNA samples of lung tissue included samples obtained by transbronchial needle biopsy, bronchial brush, pleural and pericardial fluid from 217 patients with advanced NSCLC seen at Cleveland Clinic. This also included a consecutive series of 179 samples collected from 174 patients between December 2012 and August 2013. Here we demonstrated on a large cohort that ALK-FISH testing can successfully be performed directly on ThinPrep liquid based cytology slides. Using ThinPrep slides over direct smears for ALK-FISH testing can be advantageous for many of the reasons liquid based preparations are preferred for cytology diagnosis purposes. More importantly, several advantages can be envisioned for performing ALK-FISH directly on ThinPrep slides as compared to slides derived from FFPE cytoblocks. In addition to the already mentioned superior adequacy for sufficient tumor compared to FFPE tissue sections, cytologic preparations such as ThinPrep allow assessment of the entire tumor cell nucleus, thus avoiding signal loss by section artifacts or incomplete penetration of probes into the tissue, and providing more accurate signal counts. Furthermore, the etching of areas with abundant tumor directly on the ThinPrep slides at the time of diagnosis allows precise FISH probe enumeration in tumor cells without interference from normal cells. Indeed, consistent with the previous report,11 we observed robust FISH signals on the B D Figure 1. Representative images of NSCLC positive for ALK rearrangements by ThinPrep-FISH showing a typical positive pattern (A, B 1000x), and positive for ALK expression by D5F3-IHC on the cytoblock (C, H&E 400x; D, D5F3-IHC, 400x). 11 Pathology Innovations | Clinical | Translational ThinPrep slides, with representation of the both described patterns (separated green and red signals as well as isolated red signals) in the positive cases. 4. Rikova K, Guo A, Zeng Q, et al. Global survey of phosphotyrosine signaling identifies oncogenic kinases in lung cancer. Cell. 2007;131:1190-1203. Our consecutive case subseries included 9 NSCLC specimens positive for ALK rearrangements by ThinPrep-FISH. The percentage of ALK-positive samples in our study (9/179, 5% in the consecutive series; 18/228, 7.8% overall) was within the cited range (2-13%).3 The increased proportion of positive cases overall compared to the consecutive subseries is likely due to the fact that multiple unique specimens were analyzed for several patients with ALK-positive tumors biopsied before December 2012. 5. Soda M, Choi YL, Enomoto M, et al. Identification of the transforming EML4-ALK fusion gene in non-small-cell lung cancer. Nature. 2007;448:561-566. Due to the high failure of ALK-FISH on cytoblocks, we used ultrasensitive immunohistochemistry (IHC) as a reference. We previously demonstrated that ultrasensitive D5F3 ALK-IHC for ALK has nearly perfect correlation with ALK-FISH and is informative in cases with limited tumor cells on the FFPE cytoblocks that are otherwise inadequate for FISH testing. In the current study, ThinPrep-FISH showed a high correlation with ALK-IHC in assessing ALK status, with 100% sensitivity and 98.6% specificity. In our study, there were significantly fewer uninformative ThinPrep-FISH results due to sample quality or quantity when compared to ALK-IHC (0.8% vs 27%, p<0.001). Furthermore, within 74 samples with uninformative ALK-IHC and successful ThinPrep-FISH, the latter test was positive in 6 cases (8.1%). This data indicates that ThinPrep-FISH can be successfully utilized on cytology samples that are limited or suboptimal for cytoblock analysis by FFPE-FISH or IHC, and can effectively detect a subset of positive cases that would be otherwise missed by FFPE-FISH or IHC analysis alone. Taken together, our data demonstrates that ThinPrep-FISH represents a reliable method for initial ALK testing in NSCLC. References 1. Siegel R, Naishadham D, Jemal A. Cancer statistics, 2012.

Dr. Tubbs passed away on Saturday, April 19, after battling cancer. Dr. Tubbs was a true innovator and leader, having served as staff in the Robert J. Tomsich Pathology & Laboratory Medicine Institute for more than 35 years. He truly impacted not only Cleveland Clinic, but the national and international pathology and laboratory medicine community. We will be forever inspired by his contributions to hematopathology, molecular oncology and molecular pathology. Dr. Tubbs earned his doctorate at Kirksville College of Osteopathic Medicine in 1973. He then came to Cleveland Clinic for internship and residency training in Internal Medicine. He completed an additional residency in Anatomic & Clinical Pathology in 1978 and joined the staff in Clinical Pathology. He later added a joint appointment in Cancer Biology in the Lerner Research Institute. He served as Chairman of the Department of Clinical Pathology from 1997-2007, and was a Professor of Pathology in the Lerner College of Medicine until his death. Dr. Tubbs published more than 600 peer-reviewed articles, reflecting his relentless pursuit of new ideas and discoveries that might make a difference for patients. He co-authored two of the articles featured in this issue of Pathology Innovations. Many of the diagnostic tests he pioneered are now standard practice. Those who worked with him or were mentored by him will continue to be inspired by his focused work ethic, love of learning and integrity. Kandice Kottke-Marchant, MD, PhD Chair, Robert J.

Procop, MD Gary W. Procop, MD Medical Director, Enterprise Test Utilization & Pathology Consultative Services Director, Molecular Microbiology, Parasitology and Mycology Laboratories Professor of Pathology, Cleveland Clinic Lerner College of Medicine The current healthcare climate is providing a great opportunity for pathologists and other laboratorians to take a leadership role in decreasing unnecessary laboratory testing. Decreasing unnecessary testing results in decreased phlebotomy and potentially iatrogenic anemia, increased patient satisfaction and reduced overall healthcare costs. Presented here are successful strategies we developed and/or implemented to reduce inappropriate laboratory testing. Unnecessary testing presents patient satisfaction and safety issues. The more tests performed, the greater the potential for error (i.e., there is a false-positive rate associated with any test that has a specificity less than 100%). From a patient satisfaction standpoint, it stands to reason that fewer phlebotomies would be associated with greater satisfaction. From a patient safety standpoint, excessive phlebotomies may cause iatrogenic anemia, which is associated with poor wound healing and increased infection rates. Finally, overutilization of laboratory testing also creates unnecessary financial burdens for hospitals, patients and third-party payers in this ever-tightening era of healthcare reform. Addressing this issue at Cleveland Clinic, a physician-led group practice, was a substantial challenge, given the sheer size of this tertiary care medical center, the volume of laboratory testing and the complexity of our patient population. 2 Our success was made possible through an open and transparent process, the support of leadership, the multidisciplinary participation of individuals from throughout the organization, our willingness to learn and change, and the inclusion of high-level partners from Information Technology (IT). The Test Utilization Committee at Cleveland Clinic is a multidisciplinary taskforce whose members are interested in defining best practices associated with laboratory testing. This group truly adheres to Cleveland Clinic’s “Patients First” principle. We would never compromise the quality of care for cost savings. If an expensive test is needed to secure a diagnosis or guide therapy, then we support the use of such tests. However, we recognize there is substantial waste in the system and that better utilization of these resources could also contribute to enhanced patient care by bettering the system as a whole. To enhance membership, diversity and expertise, we submitted invitations for participation to all Institute and Department Chairs in our institution. It is a committee open to anyone interested in defining best practices, optimizing test utilization and performing cost-effective medicine. We also partnered with high-level information technology officers to aid in the electronic implementation of our endeavors, largely through the computerized physician order entry system (CPOE). Both our Institute Chair and the Chief of Medical Operations, who in turn received support from the Chief of Staff and CEO, approved the entire process. The Same Day Duplicate Test Reduction Initiative The advent of CPOE systems allows the opportunity to interact with physicians at the point-of-test entry, so as to assist with optimal ordering. Such methods can be used to guide physicians to the correct test, when the test selection is complex and it can be used to notify the physicians of duplicate test orders. It is important to be sensitive to the physician’s perspective, since excessive alerts are intrusive and distracting and, therefore, often ignored. We discovered in early pilot studies that the use of best practice alerts (BPA) had mixed results. The BPA designed was essentially a “pop-up” window that notified the physician that the test they were trying to order had already been ordered that day. The clinician then had to choose whether or not to proceed with the duplicate order. Clinicians with subspecialty expertise who were caring for a select patient population tended to do the right thing, which was not order the duplicate test. In contrast, when we introduced this same type of intervention for all providers for a commonly used laboratory test (e.g., C. difficile testing), then the alert was largely ignored. We have evidence that, when offered the opportunity to electronically bypass, these busy providers often just “clicked through” the alert. These studies provided evidence that a hard stop option should be explored to eliminate or drastically reduce this unnecessary, duplicate testing. The test utilization committee, in partnership with information technology representatives and institutional leadership, embarked on what would come to commonly be known as the “Hard Stop” initiative. We first identified a dozen tests that were deemed never to be needed more than once per day in medical practice. These were vetted by the entire medical staff through notification on the institutional web page, which is the home page for all providers. Although we were allowed to initiate a full electronic stop on these duplicate orders, we were also required to build an alternative avenue for ordering, in the event the attending physician absolutely wanted the repeat test. We achieved this through the engagement of our Client Services Department, which would record the name of the ordering physician, their department, and the reason the duplicate test should be performed. Providers that demanded duplicates were few, but the information gathered was educational and provocative. There were no provider complaints associated with this initiative, so we progressively activated the hard stop clinical decision support tool (CDST) for all tests the Test Utilization Committee deemed to be appropriate. In a conscious manner to achieve substantial success and avoid conflict and complaints, any tests for which there was any contention were not assigned to this list. This substantial implementation was associated with only minor unanticipated complications, which were rapidly resolved. The presence of an informational technologist, who was intimately engaged in this project and who could quickly remove tests from the hard stop list, was critical to responding rapidly to clinical needs and helping to maintain end-user confidence in the process. In the first full year of implementation of the Same Day Duplicate Test Reduction Initiative, the use of this CDST resulted in the discontinuation of 7,243 unnecessary duplicate orders. The total laboratory cost avoidance (i.e., materials plus labor) was $115,590. Costs associated with providers either performing phlebotomies (i.e., nurse draws) or responding to duplicate test results was not captured, but may be equally significant. We reviewed patient safety data for the first year and there were no issues associated with this intervention. Since it began in January 2011, this initiative has resulted in stopping 18,160 unnecessary duplicate tests for a cumulative cost savings of $295,507 (Figure 1). This initiative is considered a success, since it is thought to have improved patient care and satisfaction by decreasing unnecessary phlebotomies, and decreased costs. Restricting the Ordering of Genetic Tests Genetic testing has become extremely complex and very costly. We were concerned with test ordering patterns, since there were very few individuals who could adequately interpret these tests, yet any intern or resident could order the assay. Therefore, we undertook our second major initiative, which was limiting the individuals who could order complex molecular genetic tests, some of which cost thousands of dollars. We reasoned that since chemotherapy is only given by an oncologist and certain antimicrobials are limited to infectious disease clinicians, then some restrictions would be appropriate. We proposed that the best practice would be to limit the ordering of complex molecular genetic tests to those individuals who were knowledgeable about the diseases for which the tests were designed (i.e., they routinely cared for the select patient population that required testing). 3 With the support of institutional leadership, we offered “deemed status” to physicians who met the above criteria. These individuals could order molecular genetic tests on an outpatient basis, whereas inpatient testing required a consultation with Medical Genetics. Individuals who were not a “deemed user” could obtain the genetic testing, but only after consultation and approval of either Medical Genetics or another deemed user, or approval by the laboratory. Laboratory approval included a thorough review by a genetics counselor, as well as approval by the molecular genetic pathologist. Started in November 2011, this initiative has resulted in the avoidance of 273 tests for a cumulative cost savings of $711,026, as of December 2013 (Figure 2). This was both an inpatient and outpatient initiative. The outpatient component was associated with a loss of revenue, but this was considered acceptable by the institution since it was considered a best practice. Significant credit is given to institutional leaders who will take a monetary shortfall to implement a best practice. Truly, a path less traveled. Genetics Testing Review and Triage The presence of genetics counselors within the laboratory has proven to be highly successful in other reference laboratory settings. These highly knowledgeable individuals can participate in the sign-out of complex genetic test results (e.g., chromosomal microarray analysis) and provide great pre-analytic value through test selection guidance and triage. These individuals also contribute in the post-analytic setting by providing guidance with respect to the need for genetic counseling and follow-up testing. There are some instances wherein the genetics counselor needs the assistance of a pathologist trained in genetics and/or molecular genetic pathology (MGP). We have employed a genetics counselor and a molecular genetic pathologist to review testing requests and interact with clinicians to guide testing and help stop unnecessary testing. The interventions and guidance from this team in 2013 resulted in the prevention of 151 unnecessary genetic tests and a cost avoidance of $340,966. The impact of all interventions of this team, which began in September 2011, has resulted in the prevention of 261 unnecessary orders for a total cost avoidance of $820,887 (Figure 3). Significantly, this approach does not just stop unnecessary testing, but also provides guidance to the appropriate test — that’s World Class Care! Regional Smart Alerts An initiative was undertaken to expand the best practices and cost-savings initiatives achieved with the Hard Stops to Cleveland Clinic’s regional hospitals. Through discussions with all involved, it was decided the Hard Stop CDST would not be optimal for the regional hospitals for a variety of reasons, including provider mix and incomplete provider use of order entry. Therefore it was decided that a duplicate order notification (i.e., a Smart Alert) would be the best CDST to introduce. 4 Although providers are discouraged from proceeding with the duplicate test in the Smart Alert configuration and are provided the results from the previous test, if available, they have the ability to continue and place the duplicate order from their workstation. Although there is some benefit from this type of intervention, it is clearly not as effective as the Hard Stop CDST. Begun in February 2013, this initiative has prevented 5,625 duplicate tests for a total cost savings of $46,031. However, the Smart Alert was activated 14,020 times, so the 5,625 times clinicians adhered to the alert represents only a 40.1% success rate for this intervention. When compared with the 93% success rate of the Hard Stop CDST, it suggests there are some missed cost-savings opportunities with this type of CDST (Figure 4). Expensive Test Notification This initiative was undertaken to make providers aware of the costs of tests that exceed $1,000. The notifications were bracketed in $1,000 increments (i.e., >$1,000, >$2,000, etc.) (Figure 5). The project began in March 2013 and by December 2013, 66 expensive tests have been averted based on this notification (i.e., the provider began to place the order, the alert fired, and the provider did not continue to place the order). These resulted in a cost savings of $91,828. Figure 1 Figure 2 5 Figure 3 Figure 4 6 Figure 5 Cumulative Cost Saving through December 2013 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. Hard Stops Restricted Use Genetics Counselor/MGP Regional Smart Alert Expensive Test Notification 18,160 $295,507 273 $711,026 261 $820,887 5,625 $ 46,031 66 $ 91,828 TOTAL 24,385 $1,965,279 The Future There are a number of new initiatives under way or planned. These include an “extended hard stop” project that will extend the time period during which a duplicate test will not be allowed. For example, a constitutional molecular genetic test never needs to be repeated in a patient’s lifetime. Additionally, it is clear that there is no value to a repeat C. difficile PCR testing within seven days of having received a positive result and the value following a negative result within this time frame would be minimal at best. Finally, a CDST is being deployed to stop ova and parasite and stool culture order requests on patients hospitalized more than three days. These and other projects will occupy the time of Cleveland Clinic’s Test Utilization Committee in the near future, as we continually strive to improve patient care and prepare for the challenges of health care reform. Conclusion The Test Utilization Committee has raised the bar in asking for a quality assessment, “is this test really needed?” Multidisciplinary collaborations, institutional support, good project management and reporting, and great informational technology support led to results that no one group could have achieved alone. Most importantly, we believe we have improved the patient experience, decreased unnecessary phlebotomy for the commonly used tests, improved the use of molecular genetic tests and decreased healthcare costs. Importantly, our initiatives never interrupted patient care. While we wanted to ensure there was considerable thought before a test was ordered, we have always provided an avenue for ordering if the physician really believed he or she needed a test. The entire process has been an enjoyable lesson in team building and enhancing practice within the system.

Cleveland Clinic Laboratories’ Department of Molecular Pathology boasts an expansive menu of tests that range from commercially available moderately complex assays to esoteric and highly complex molecular diagnostic tests. With every test result, the department is focused on delivering personalized, world-class service and total customer satisfaction. The structure of the Department of Molecular Pathology was developed with the goal of fostering in-depth knowledge and expertise in all of the areas that require such testing, as evidenced by the sections within the department. In addition, it is our goal to develop and maintain expertise in the specific molecular diagnostic technologies that are needed to offer a full menu of diagnostic testing to meet the needs of our clients and their patients. Sections The Department of Molecular Pathology contains five sections, which are recognized by leading national organizations. These sections include: • Cytogenetics: Performs traditional and molecular chromosomal analysis that encompasses constitutional and neoplastic disease. • Molecular Genetic Pathology: Performs a variety of analyses that assess for an array of germline disorders. • Molecular Hematopathology: Offers numerous PCR, FISH and other molecular assays for abnormalities associated with hematolymphoid disease. • Molecular Oncologic Pathology: Provides integrative molecular pathology diagnostic services for a variety of tumor types. • Molecular Microbiology: Responsible for the molecular detection and characterization of infectious agents. Cleveland Clinic Laboratories Staffing, Structure and Experience Our anatomic and clinical pathologists were among the first to routinely use molecular tests in the clinical setting, making our team of pathologists and technologists one of the most experienced teams in the country in clinical applications and interpretation of molecular testing. The majority of our anatomic and clinical pathologists have primary appointments in their respective departments with joint appointments in Molecular Pathology. This inclusion of our world-class staff members in the Department of Molecular Pathology helps to assure professional level interaction with respect to molecular target selection, diagnostic assay verification and, whenever possible, integrated results reporting. In this manner, we assure that the pathologist most knowledgeable about the type of disease present (i.e. the subspecialty expert) is able to produce a single, integrated report that contains both traditional, immunohistochemical and molecular diagnostic findings. Operational Cores The Department of Molecular Pathology achieves efficiencies by operating a number of core laboratories within Cleveland Clinic Laboratories around key technologies. The cores consist of: • Materials handling core • Extraction core • Rapid-cycle and traditional polymerase chain reaction (PCR) core • Commercial assays core • Cytogenetic core • Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) core • Sequencing core • Microarray core • Methylation and epigenetics core This core concept provides us the opportunity to integrate continuous improvement tools to optimize laboratory productivity, which in turn translates into better turnaround time for patient results. Although a high degree of efficiency is a goal of each core, a keen eye is maintained on quality metrics and quality improvement initiatives are ongoing. 9500 Euclid Avenue | Cleveland, Ohio 44195 | 216.444.5755 | 800.628.6816 | clevelandcliniclabs.com Molecular Pathology Staff Gary Procop, MD Chair, Molecular Pathology; Section Head, Clinical and Molecular Microbiology Board Certifications: Medical Microbiology, Anatomic Pathology, Clinical Pathology Specialty Interests: Infectious disease pathology, molecular microbiology, parasitology Phone: 216.444.5879 Email: procopg@ccf.org Yu-Wei Cheng, PhD Technical Core Director, Molecular Pathology Specialty Interests: Molecular genetics, cancer genetics, epigenetics and clinical application of next-generation sequencing Phone: 216.445.0757 Email: chengy@ccf.org James Cook, MD, PhD Section Head, Molecular Hematopathology Board Certifications: Hematology, Anatomic Pathology Specialty Interest: Hematopathology Phone: 216.444.4435 Email: cookj2@ccf.org Roger Klein, MD, JD Board Certifications: Clinical Pathology, Molecular Genetic Pathology Specialty Interest: Molecular genetics Phone: 216.445.0776 Email: kleinr3@ccf.org Felicitas Lacbawan, MD Section Head, Molecular Genetic Pathology Board Certifications: Clinical Pathology, Anatomic Pathology, Clinical Genetics, Molecular Genetic Pathology Specialty Interests: Clinical genetics and molecular genetic pathology of various disorders including neurologic and developmental disorders and chromosomal abnormalities Phone: 216.445.0761 Email: lacbawf@ccf.org Roy Lee, MD Associate Medical Director, Center for Pathology Informatics Board Certifications: Anatomic Pathology, Clinical Pathology Specialty Interests: Personalized medicine, bioinformatics, whole genome sequencing Phone: 216.444.8096 Email: leer3@ccf.org Shashirekha Shetty, PhD Section Head, Cytogenetics Board Certification: Clinical Cytogenetics Specialty Interests: Cytogenomic microarrays, constitutional cytogenetics, cancer cytogenetics, molecular cytogenetics Phone: 216.636.5844 Email: shettys@ccf.org Raymond Tubbs, DO Medical Director, Cleveland Clinic Laboratories; Section Head, Molecular Oncologic Pathology Board Certifications: Molecular Genetic Pathology, Hematology, Anatomic Pathology, Clinical Pathology Specialty Interests: Molecular pathology, hematopathology Phone: 216.444.2844 Email: tubbsr@ccf.org Every life deserves world class care. 9500 Euclid Avenue, Cleveland, OH 44195 Cleveland Clinic is an integrated healthcare delivery system with a main campus. 18 family health centers, eight community hospitals and locations in Ohio, Florida, Nevada, Toronto and Abu Dhabi.

Diseases or circumstances that may be associated with these symptoms include diabetes, collagen vascular disease, metabolic disease, familiar neuropathies, a neoplasm or trauma. The biopsy may be from several different muscles, such as the deltoid, biceps or triceps of the arms, the gastrocnemius, rectus, tibial or vastus lateralis of the legs, or the abdominal rectus. These specimens arrive at the laboratory either fresh from the operating room on saline-moistened Telfa gauze or from the Reference Lab. Those coming from the Reference Lab are either fresh on saline-moistened Telfa gauze at refrigerator temperature or partially processed with the frozen portion on dry ice and the refrigerated portion and room temperature portion on ice. Muscle biopsy specimens must be accompanied by a completed requisition and muscle/nerve worksheet. Fresh specimens are placed into the refrigerator during accessioning for processing. Frozen specimens are placed in the –80° C freezer during accessioning for processing. Specimen Requirements 1. Optimal conditions are a fresh specimen on saline-moistened Telfa gauze received at refrigerator temperature, Monday through Friday 7 a.m. – 5 p.m. 2. Processing of specimens received from outside facilities depends on the specimen portions received. Fresh or frozen portions canbe processed for enzyme histochemistry. Portions in glutaraldehyde can be processed by electron microscopy (EM). Portions in 10% neutral buffered formalin (NBF) can be processed by light microscopy or microscopic slides and/or paraffin blocks. Including all of the above portions ensures the most complete testing. 3. Specimens must be properly labeled and accompanied by a surgical pathology requisition completed by the originating clinician. The specimen container should be labeled with the patient’s name, medical number (for Cleveland Clinic patients), date of birth, and social security number. (A minimum of two identifiers must be present on both the specimen container(s) and requisition.) 4. Specimen must be received with a muscle/nerve worksheet.

Bottle labeled with expiration date. Freezing for enzyme histochemistry (EH) 1. Select a large cross-section of the muscle with minimal fat. 2. Label a chuck with the patient’s name, surgical number, and “muscle bx.” 3. Label a vial cap with patient’s name, surgical number, “muscle bx,” and location within the capsule. 4. Mold a pyramid of gum tragacanth on the chuck. 5. Fill the vacuum flask with liquid nitrogen. 6. Fill the test tube with 15 cc of isopentane and promptly return to the explosion-proof refrigerator (*DO NOT LEAVE THE BOTTLE OUT WITH THE CAP ON.) 7. Use the fine forceps to place the specimen in the center of the gum tragacanth, orienting it so the cross section is up. 8. Place the test tube of isopentane (2-methylbutane) in the vacuum flask of liguid nitrogen, securing it with a plastic lid. 9. When crystals have formed on the bottom of the test tube, the isopentane (2-methylbutane) is ready to use. 10. Pick up the chuck with the long-handled forceps in an inverted position 11. Remove the test tube of isopentane, holding it while inverting the specimen into the tube. Do not completely submerge the specimen. Lower it until the muscle is covered. 12. Count one, one thousand, two, one thousand up until ten, one thousand. 13. Completely lower the chuck to the bottom of the tube. 14. Quickly remove the chuck. 15. Pick up the vial with the long-handled forceps and submerge into the liquid nitrogen. Pre-chill the cap of the vial in the same way. 16. Place the chuck into the vial and cap the vial. 17. Place the vial into the liquid nitrogen, using the long-handled forceps, for a second to complete freezing. 18. Place the vial into the –80°C freezer. 19. The frozen portion of the muscle should be sent to Cleveland Clinic on dry ice to maintain the frozen state. If the specimen does not maintain the frozen state, ice crystals will form and the specimen will not be optimal for diagnosis. 9500 Euclid Avenue | Cleveland, Ohio 44195 | 216.444.2200 | 800-628-6816 | http://referencelab.clevelandclinic.org Submitting for light microscopy 1. Select a cross section and a longitudinal section of the sample. 2. Orient the muscle on a microscopic slide, gently stretching the longitudinal segment. 3. Fix the slide in 10% neutral buffered formalin (NBF). 4. Place the fixed tissue into a labeled container of 10% NBF for transport. 5. This portion of the specimen can be submitted at room temperature or refrigerator temperature. 6. H&E microscopic slides and the paraffin blocks may be sent as an alternative to the above procedure. Submitting for electron microscopy (EM) Tissue will be needed for mitochondrial disorders, metabolic disorders, storage disorders, inclusion body myositis (IBM), polymositis, and all pediatric cases. For other clinical histories, a piece is placed into glutaradehyde for EM hold, and a piece is not snap frozen 1. For EM / EM hold, a longitudinal segment is required. 2. Label a glutaraldehyde vial with the surgical pathology number, patient’s name, “muscle bx,” and EM. 3. Gently stretch the segment on a microscope slide. 4. Place the slide into a specimen cup, pouring the gluteraldehyde from the vial over the specimen. 5. After approximately 10 minutes, transfer the specimen and glutaraldehyde back to the vial. 6. Place the vial containing the EM specimen into the refrigerator until ready to transport.

Cleveland Clinic is ranked among America’s top hospitals overall, and among the nation’s leaders in every major medical specialty (U.S.News & World Report). clevelandclinic.org © The Cleveland Clinic Foundation 2014 201401.003","url":"assets/pdfs/brochures/anatomic-pathology-special-stains.pdf"},{"title":"informed-consent-for-huntington-disease-dna-testing.pdf","text":"","url":"assets/pdfs/forms/informed-consent-for-huntington-disease-dna-testing.pdf"},{"title":"genetic-testing-information.pdf","text":"CLEVELAND CLINIC LABORATORIES REFERENCE LABORATORY INFORMED CONSENT FOR GENETIC TESTING Patient Last Name:__________________________________ Patient First Name:________________________________ Date of Birth: ____/____/____ Gender: Male Female I request genetic testing for the following condition(s) or clinical indications:___________________________ _________________________________________________________________________________________________________ The intended purpose is: Carrier Prenatal Diagnostic Predictive Sample type: Blood Skin Cheek swab Tissue block Amniotic Fluid Chorionic villi (placenta sample) Prognostic/Therapeutic Other______________ I request the following test(s) be performed: _____________________________________________________________________ __________________________________________________________________________________________________________ 1. I understand that the biological specimen identified above as the “sample type” will be obtained from me/my child (the “Specimen”). I request and authorize Cleveland Clinic Laboratories (“CCL”) to test the Specimen for the genetic condition(s) stated above. By signing below, I acknowledge that the benefits, risks, limitations, and alternatives of this testing have been explained to me by a qualified health professional. 2. I understand that the purpose of this genetic testing is to attempt to determine if I/my child is affected with, is a carrier of, or is at risk of developing the genetic disease or condition listed above. I understand that genetic test results may confirm my/my child’s clinical diagnosis, carrier status or future risks of developing this disease or condition. The results may also identify a condition not suspected clinically. The genetic test results may also predict whether another member of my family has, is a carrier of, or is at risk of developing this disease or condition. 3. In many cases, a genetic test detects an inherited abnormality. An inherited abnormality is one that is passed from parent to child. One type of genetic testing called molecular testing may detect a change in the DNA. DNA acts as the building blocks for genes and genes carry the blueprints for inherited traits. Another form of testing called cytogenetic testing may identify extra, missing or rearranged genetic material. 4. I understand that it is possible for genetic testing to reveal unexpected information, such as a genetic disease or condition that I/my child might have that was unknown to me prior to the genetic testing. Genetic test results may also detect unknown information about family relationships such as adoption or parentage. It may be necessary to share this kind of unexpected information with me if the results could directly affect my/my child’s medical care. 5. The meaning of a positive and a negative test result has been explained to me. A positive result usually means that I/my child has or may be at risk for the disease or condition; however further testing may be required to confirm the diagnosis. I understand that it is possible for test results to be negative even if I/my child has this genetic disease or condition. The chance of this happening depends on the medical and family history, the gene(s) being tested and the type of genetic test. 6. I also understand that the genetic test results may be unclear or difficult to interpret. This may be due to current understanding of the genetic disorder or condition and/or technical limitations of the test. 7. I understand that there is a chance of error, even though the genetic test is considered to be the most clinically appropriate at this time. Causes of error may include clinical misdiagnosis of the condition or inaccurate Rev 08/05/2013 Page 1 of 2 information regarding medical and family history, among others. An error in diagnosis may occur if I do not accurately disclose biological relationships of my family. 8. I understand that genetic counseling is recommended before and after genetic testing. My health care provider can provide genetic counseling or refer me to another provider for genetic counseling. 9. Because genetic testing is complex and the test results are important for my medical care, my results will be reported directly to my doctor or genetic counselor so that he or she can explain them to me. Genetic test results are confidential. They will only be released with my written consent or as permitted or required by law. 10. I understand that genetic test results may impact my ability to obtain disability, long term care or life insurance for myself/my child. These results may also impact health insurance rates and/or the ability to find employment if not otherwise protected by law. It is my responsibility to consider the potential impact of the genetic test results before having genetic testing. There is a federal law that addresses genetic information, called the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act of 2008. More information about this law is available at http://www.genome.gov/10002328. 11. I will be responsible for payment for genetic testing if I/my child does not have insurance coverage for the test. It is my responsibility to confirm that my/my child’s insurance plan covers the genetic testing before having the test performed. 12. CCL cannot guarantee that my/my child’s Specimen will be available for future clinical testing. After personal information is removed, the Specimen may be stored indefinitely to be used for quality assurance or medical education, or research if a special review process required by medical research and privacy laws is completed.. 13. My participation in this genetic testing is completely voluntary. 14. I understand that the alternative to having this genetic testing performed is not having the genetic testing performed and to be treated without the added knowledge of the genetic test results. My signature below acknowledges my voluntary participation in this genetic testing. I understand that the genetic testing performed by CCL is not intended to identify all genetic conditions that I/my child may have. This genetic testing in no way guarantees my/my child’s health, the health of an unborn child, or the health of other family members.

Earlier this year Congress voted to discontinue a Medicare exception that permitted independent laboratories to bill Medicare directly for the technical component of pathology services rendered for inpatients and outpatients of “grandfathered” hospitals. The exception had been in place since 1999 and expired on June 30, 2012. As a result, Cleveland Clinic Laboratories is no longer permitted to bill Medicare directly for the technical component of pathology services paid on the Medicare physician fee schedule. Why? Medicare reimbursement to hospitals for all registered inpatient and outpatient services (including laboratory) is considered fully reimbursed under existing prospective payment systems (DRG-diagnosis related group, and APC-ambulatory payment classification, respectively). How will this change my bill? In order to comply with this new billing requirement, the Cleveland Clinic Laboratories will now bill the technical portion of these services back to the referring client effective for dates of service on or after July 1, 2012. Which patient settings are included? Medicare and Medicare Advantage patients that are registered inpatient or outpatient. What spectrum of tests is affected by this change? Any test with a technical and professional component on the Medicare physician fee schedule, including but not limited to anatomic pathology, flow cytometry, professionally interpreted molecular and clinical pathology tests). Will the lab continue to bill professional component directly to Medicare? Yes. Will the lab begin client billing technical component for payors other than Medicare and Medicare Advantage? No, we will continue to bill third party for technical component for all other payors. In cases where multiple parties are involved, who will be client billed for the technical component services? The party sending the specimen will receive the bill. Alternative arrangements (eg for pathology groups contracted with hospitals) will be considered upon request in advance. How much will I be charged for the client billed services?

By pursuing certification of the facility through the LEED NC v2.2 rating system, the Owner has committed the Team and the Project to “green” goals and enhanced sustainable performance in the following categories: • Sustainable Sites • Water Efficiency • Energy & Atmosphere • Materials & Resources • Indoor Environmental Quality • Innovation and Design Process What is LEED Certification? LEED, Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design, is an internationally-recognized green building certification system. LEED provides a framework for identifying and implementing practical and measurable green building process, providing a measuring tool which tracks and documents sustainable building and development practices. Through this rating system, LEED certification recognizes projects that implement strategies for better environmental and health performance. Certification priorities are weighted by environmental impact. An overview of the LL Building’s achievements in each category of work can be found on the reverse. Sustainable Sites 11 points out of 14 possible The project is being constructed on a previously occupied site and has close proximity to several public transportation options. The building’s east-west orientation maximizes the long building elevations to admit daylighting with minimum cost for shading and sun control. A relatively narrow building profile allows daylight to penetrate deep into the floor plans. Permeable site pavers and a green roof will also contribute to the improvement of water quality and a reduction in stormwater runoff quantity. On-site parking has been minimized and is available for couriers only. Water Efficiency 3 points out of 5 possible Through the use of water efficient irrigation systems, automated communication with the campus weather station, porous concrete, permeable pavers, and drought tolerant landscaper materials, the Pathology & Laboratory Medicine Institute is designed to reduce potable water use by 83% compared to a baseline building. Energy and Atmosphere 12 points out of 17 possible The building incorporates extensive exterior and interior glazing to maximize of daylighting opportunities. Horizontal sunshades on East, West and South facades reduce solar heat gain in summer. Daylight responsive lighting controls, LED lighting and exhaust air energy recovery will help achieve a 41.6% improvement in the proposed building energy performance compared to the baseline model. Additionally, all refrigerants used in HVAC systems are free of ozone depleting CFCs. Materials and Resources 5 points out of 13 possible Extracting, transporting, manufacturing and disposing of construction materials are a large part of the environmental impact of a building. Extra effort was made to source regionally manufactured materials that have the maximum amount of recycled content. Of the construction waste produced on site, 60% was diverted from landfill through recycling efforts. Indoor Environmental Quality 11 points out of 15 possible Improved air quality will be achieved by ensuring that HVAC ducts are kept sealed during construction. Paints, furnishings, equipment, sealants and finishes were selected to minimize off-gassing. Finishes that contain volatile organic compounds (VOC) were prohibited from the interior of the building. Organized and efficient floor plans allow for 90% of work spaces to have views to the outside. Innovation and Design Process 5 points out of 5 possible As stewards of community health, we seek to reduce environmental impact even in daily tasks such as cleaning and ongoing occupant education. We strive for green buildings that are best suited for providing world class care, to both patients and the environment.

From the patient’s bedside to the medical laboratory, Cleveland Clinic practitioners constantly strive to improve care, seek better ways to diagnose and treat disease, and share knowledge and best practices with upcoming generations of medical personnel. Cleveland Clinic School of Cytotechnology is welcoming students who embrace these ideals to engage in our one-year, hands-on education program. 2 Cytotechnology Cytotechnology is an allied health laboratory specialty designed to aid in the diagnosis of cancer and its precursors using individual cell morphology. A cytotechnologist (CT) is a laboratory specialist who is responsible for preparing and examining human cell samples under the microscope for early signs of cancer and other diseases. The cytotechnologist meticulously reviews and analyzes subtle cell changes, both nuclear and cytoplasmic, and compares these changes to known normal cell findings from given body sites. By adding these microscopic observations to the clinical history provided, the cytotechnologist can judge the significance of the cell changes. Cytotechnologists aid pathologists in determining a patient’s diagnosis in an accurate, timely and secure manner. The cytotechnologist must be familiar with normal anatomy and histology for all the body systems that may be the sources of cytologic material and must learn the appearance of certain disease processes that affect these body sites. The cell changes that indicate these processes must be studied and the cells recognized in a background of normal material. Cytotechnologists aid in the management of patients with known malignancies by assisting with fine needle aspiration (FNA) biopsies, minimally invasive procedures that can, in addition to initial diagnosis, help track the spread of disease. When used in conjunction with radiologic and ultrasound techniques, FNA can target small, difficult to reach areas of the body. Cytotechnologists are employed in laboratories, community and military hospitals or large teaching institutions. Upward mobility and additional opportunities for cytotechnologists are available in the area of molecular diagnostics, where the need for trained morphologists blends well with the skills learned in cytology. Additional information about cytotechnology can be found at the following sites: cytopathology.org (American Society of Cytopathology) and asct.com (American Society for Cytotechnology). 3 Take a step in the right direction… become a Cytotechnologist At this time, there are no application fees or tuition charges for students enrolled in Cleveland Clinic’s School of Cytotechnology. Students are required to purchase textbooks and supplies and are responsible for their living expenses including meals, transportation, liability insurance and health insurance including hospitalization. The program is not responsible for any of these expenses should a student withdraw or be dismissed.

Tomsich Pathology and Laboratory Medicine Institute 3 Specialized Diagnostic and Consultative Services 4 To evaluate patients with recurrent thrombosis, Cleveland Clinic Laboratories offers a well-defined array of testing for inherited and acquired abnormalities related to the hypercoagulable state. Our comprehensive testing and interpretative capabilities aid in diagnosing and planning appropriate intervention for these patients. For patients with suspected congenital or acquired bleeding disorders, such as von Willebrand disease or hemophilia, we offer consultation by a pathologist with expertise in designing appropriate laboratory approaches for evaluation of coagulation, and fibrinolytic and platelet function for pinpointing these difficult-to-diagnose problems. In addition to a complete range of diagnostic testing services, we also offer monitoring services for patients on anticoagulants, such as heparin, fondaparinux or warfarin. We offer testing to screen for resistance to antiplatelet drugs, such as aspirin or clopidogrel. Our staff are experienced in evaluating bleeding disorders in patients on anticoagulation therapy and in designing a diagnostic approach for evaluating the cause of heparin resistance. We offer pharmacogenetic testing to help clinicians select the appropriate dosing for warfarin and clopidogrel. In consultation with the referring physician, our pathologists can develop a customized testing plan to meet the needs of the patient with a complex or unusual hemostasis disorder. Core Laboratory Services In addition to our traditional reference laboratory services, we offer complete core laboratory services for large, multicenter hemostasis research studies and clinical trials. Our experience in this area includes site coordination, protocol development, sample kit design and preparation, assay performance, database entry and data analysis. 5 Research Research in the evaluation and development of state-of-the-art techniques and instrumentation to enhance the diagnosis of hemostasis disorders is constantly in progress. Our research focuses on the development of new diagnostic laboratory tests for monitoring antiplatelet drugs, study of genetic risk factors for thrombosis and antiplatelet drug resistance, diagnostic assays for heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, and platelet flow cytometric techniques for diagnosing platelet dysfunction and activation. We are also involved in clinical trials of new antithrombotic agents, hemostatic evaluation of patients with artificial organs, and basic research to investigate the biocompatibility of biomaterials. 6 Continuing Education Hemostasis and thrombosis lectures and educational programs are available for your professional and technical staff upon request.

Specimen Collection For most coagulation tests and factor assays, use the following instructions. For individual requirements, refer to specific tests. Obtain venous blood by drawing a clearing tube prior to obtaining the specimen. Draw the specimen in a light blue top sodium citrate tube using 3.2% buffered sodium citrate with a 19- to 21-gauge needle. Avoid stasis and contamination of the specimen by tissue thromboplastin. Mix blood with anticoagulant (3.2% buffered sodium citrate) by gentle inversion. Use 0.5 ml sodium citrate for every 4.5 ml blood. An exact ratio of 9 parts blood to 1 part anticoagulant should be maintained and the collection tube must be filled to at least 90% fill volume. Note: If the hematocrit of the sample is ≥ 55%, the anticoagulant ratio will not be maintained and spuriously elevated PT and APTT values will be seen. Contact the laboratory for instructions on how to draw these patients. Specimen Handling, Processing and Storage Blood specimen should be stored at room temperature and transported to the laboratory within 1 hour. The acceptable time between collection and processing depends on the coagulation test requested. Platelet functional study needs to be completed within 3-4 hours from the time of phlebotomy. Uncentrifuged Specimen Centrifuged Specimen PT Test within 24 hours Test within 24 hours Storage at 18-24°C Storage at 18-24°C APTT Test within 4 hours Test within 4 hours (nonheparin) Storage at 18-24°C Storage at 2-8°C or 18-24°C APTT Test within 1 hour Test within 4 hours (heparin) Storage at 18-24°C Storage at 2-8°C or 18-24°C Other Coagulation tests* Test within 4 hours Test within 4 hours Storage at 18-24°C Storage at 2-8°C or 18-24°C *e.g. thrombin time, protein C, factor V, factor VIII continued on back 201304.034.2 9500 Euclid Avenue | Cleveland, Ohio 44195 | 216.444.5755 | 800.628.6816 | clevelandcliniclabs.com The specimen should be visually inspected for an appropriate specimen collection, excess hemolysis, icterus or lipemia. Grossly hemolyzed specimens should not be used for coagulation testing. For most coagulation tests, it is crucial that testing be performed on platelet poor plasma, with a platelet count of <10,000/μl. The specimen should be centrifuged at 1,500 x g for no less than 15 minutes. Immediately remove 2 ml (min: 1 ml) platelet-poor plasma from the red cells using a plastic pipette. Place the plasma into a properly labeled plastic vial. Glass vials will not be accepted. The specimen should be frozen immediately at -70°C or below. Each assay requested must be submitted in a labeled, separate plastic vial. The specimen should be frozen during transport on dry ice. Technical Consideration In order to produce valid results for coagulation tests and factor assays, specimen integrity is crucial and must be maintained. Specimens should be frozen within 4 hours of phlebotomy. Short draw samples (Vacutainer less than 2/3 full) are not acceptable. Some assays may be performed on a priority basis if a medical emergency exists. Contact Customer Service to make arrangements. All requests for coagulation assays should include a brief patient history and other pertinent clinical information (i.e., medications, blood products, etc.). The Hemostasis and Thrombosis Patient Information form must be filled out and submitted with the specimen.","url":"assets/pdfs/brochures/hemostasis-and-thrombosis-services.pdf"},{"title":"hematology-diagnostic-services.pdf","text":"Cleveland Clinic Laboratories Hematology Diagnostic Services Trust in us for everything you need in a reference lab.

AML is clinically heterogeneous and can be further subclassified through the correlation of clinical data, morphology, phenotype and molecular cytogenetic abnormalities. Metaphase cytogenetic analysis has long been recognized as a crucial component of the diagnosis and classification of AML. In recent years, other molecular methods have also assumed an increasingly important role in the workup, classification, prognostic assessment and monitoring of AML. • CEBPA Mutation Analysis Interphase fluoresence in situ hybridization (FISH) studies offer the ability to rapidly detect cytogenetic abnormalities in nondividing cells. FISH studies are therefore an important adjunct to traditional banded karyotyping. FISH analysis can clarify suspected abnormalities identified in banded karyotypes, identify the presence of complex or cryptic cytogenetic abnormalities, or provide cytogenetic information even when banded karyotype data is not available. FISH studies for many recurrent cytogenetic abnormalities associated with AML are available through Cleveland Clinic Laboratories. • FISH for t(8;21) RUNX1/ RUNX1T1 (AML1/ETO) Molecular testing for specific recurrent mutations is also an important part of the workup of AML. AML with mutations in NPM1 and CEBPA are now recognized as distinct clinicopathologic entities with distinct prognostic implications. Testing for mutations in the FLT3 or KIT genes also provide valuable prognostic information in some patients with AML. • DNA Extraction • FISH for Acute Myeloid Leukemia Panel (t(8;21), inv(16), t(15;17), MLL) • FISH for inv(16) CBFB/ MYH11 • FISH for MLL (11q23) Translocation • FISH for RARA (17q21) Translocation • FISH for t(15;17) PML/ RARA • FISH for t(9;22) BCR/ABL1 • Flow for leukemia/lymphoma • FLT3 ITD/D835 PCR • KIT Gene Mutation AML • Nucleophosmin Gene (NPM1) Mutation • PML/RARA RTPCR, Qualitative RT-PCR testing offers the ability to detect oncogenic fusion transcripts with a sensitivity much greater than that obtained with other techniques, such as metaphase cytogenetics or FISH. In acute promyelocytic leukemia, RT-PCR analysis for PML/RARA transcripts is utilized to monitor minimal residual disease status. 11.20.12 (11.25.13 rev) 9500 Euclid Avenue | Cleveland, Ohio 44195 | 216.444.5755 | 800.628.6816 | clevelandcliniclabs.com Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia Diagnostic Overview Tests Available Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is primarily a disease of childhood, with the majority of cases occurring before age 6. ALL can be further subclassified based on the phenotypic profile and the presence of specific recurrent cytogenetic abnormalities. Approximately 80% of ALL exhibit a precursor B cell phenotype, with the remaining cases displaying a T lymphoblast phenotype. • BCR/ABL p190 RT-PCR, Quantitative • FISH for MLL (11q23) Translocation • FISH for t(12;21) ETV6/RUNX1 (TEL/AML1) • FISH for t(9;22) BCR/ABL1 • FISH for Trisomy 4, 10 and 17 • Flow for leukemia/lymphoma Interphase fluoresence in situ hybridization (FISH) studies offer the ability to rapidly detect cytogenetic abnormalities in nondividing cells. FISH studies are therefore an important adjunct to traditional banded karyotyping. FISH analysis can clarify suspected abnormalities identified in banded karyotypes, identify the presence of complex or cryptic cytogenetic abnormalities, or provide cytogenetic information even when banded karyotype data is not available. FISH studies for recurrent cytogenetic abnormalities associated with B lymphoblastic leukemia are available through Cleveland Clinic Laboratories. Real time RT-PCR testing offers the ability to detect oncogenic fusion transcripts with a sensitivity much greater than that obtained with other techniques, such as metaphase cytogenetics or FISH. In Philadelphia chromosome-positive ALL, RT-PCR analysis for p190 BCR/ABL transcripts is utilized to monitor minimal residual disease status. Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia Diagnostic Overview Tests Available Chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL) is a neoplasm of small B lymphocytes that involves the peripheral blood, bone marrow, and in some cases, the lymph nodes. Most patients with CLL are older than 50 years of age, and most cases will follow an indolent clinical course. FISH testing for recurrent cytogenetic abnormalities (13q-, +12, 11q-, and 17p-) provides important prognostic information in CLL. The Oncochip Copy Number Evaluation assay utilizes array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) to detect chromosomal copy number abnormalities across the genome, including loci not covered by FISH panels. Finally, PCR and sequencing analysis of the immunoglobulin heavy chain variable region (IGVH) also provides further prognostic information. • FISH for CLL (13q,+12,11q,17p) • Flow for leukemia/lymphoma • IGVH Sequencing • Oncochip Copy Number Evaluation Myeloproliferative Neoplasms Diagnostic Overview Tests Available The myeloproliferative neoplasms are clonal hematological disorders characterized by an abnormal proliferation of one or more myeloid lineages in the peripheral blood. Traditionally, four subtypes of myeloproliferative neoplasms have been recognized: chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), polycythemia vera (PV), essential thrombocythemia (ET) and primary myelofibrosis (PMF). More recently, three additional disorders have been identified that are identified by chromosomal rearrangements involving the PDGFRA, PDGFRB or FGFR1 genes. • BCR/ABL Kinase Domain Sequencing In CML, molecular testing is utilized in several ways. First, CML by definition carries a BCR/ABL translocation, which can be identified through metaphase cytogenetics, FISH or RT-PCR analysis. Secondly, following initiation of therapy for CML, minimal residual disease status is monitored utilizing quantitative RT-PCR for the p210 BCR/ABL fusion transcript. Finally, sequencing of the BCR/ABL kinase domain can identify mutations associated with resistance to one or more tyrosine kinase inhibitors, thereby assisting in the selection of the most appropriate therapeutic option for the patient. • FISH for Myeloproliferative Neoplasms Panel (BCR/ABL1, PDGFRA, PDGFRB, FGFR1) Molecular testing also plays an important role in the non-CML myeloproliferative neoplasms. JAK2 V617F mutations are found in >95% of PV, and in approximately 50% of ET and PMF. In the rare cases of PV lacking the V617F mutation, other mutations in exons 12-15 of JAK2 may be identified by sequencing studies. Mutations involving the MPL gene may be identified in PMF or ET lacking the JAK2 V617F mutation. FISH testing can be utilized to detect chromosomal rearrangements in PDGFRA, PDGFRB or FGFR1 that define distinct myeloproliferative neoplasms. • JAK2 V617F PCR • FISH for FGFR1 (8p12) Translocation • FISH for PDGFRA (4q12) Translocation • FISH for PDGFRB (5q32) Translocation • FISH for t(9;22) BCR/ABL1 • Flow for leukemia/lymphoma • JAK2 Exon 12-15 Sequencing • KIT D816V PCR • MPL Mutation Sequencing • p210 BCR/ABL RTPCR, Quantitative Myelodysplastic Syndromes Diagnostic Overview Tests Available The myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are clonal hematologic malignancies characterized by ineffective hematopoiesis and peripheral blood cytopenias. MDS typically present in the middle age to elderly age groups. The diagnosis and subclassification of MDS is facilitated by detection of cytogenetic abnormalities. The most common recurring abnormalities in MDS include 5q-, 7q-, +8 and 20q-. • FISH for Del(5q) Abnormalities Interphase fluoresence in situ hybridization (FISH) studies offer the ability to rapidly detect cytogenetic abnormalities in nondividing cells. FISH studies are therefore an important adjunct to traditional banded karyotyping. FISH analysis can clarify suspected abnormalities identified in banded karyotypes, identify the presence of complex or cryptic cytogenetic abnormalities, or provide cytogenetic information even when banded karyotype data is not available. FISH studies for many recurrent cytogenetic abnormalities associated with MDS are available through Cleveland Clinic Laboratories. • Flow for leukemia/lymphoma • FISH for MDS (5q,7q,+8,20q) Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma Diagnostic Overview Tests Available The non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHL) are a heterogeneous group of malignancies of mature B-cells or T-cells. Approximately 90% of NHL are derived from B-cells, with the remaining 10% being of T-cell origin. On average, NHL typically presents in adults in their sixth or seventh decade, although some specific subtypes of NHL occur more commonly in children or young adults. NHL are subclassified into distinct clinicopathologic entities on the basis of clinical features, morphology, phenotype and molecular cytogenetic findings. • B-cell clonality (BIOMED2 IGH+IGK) Molecular testing is useful to document the presence of a clonal B-cell or T-cell population in the workup of a suspected NHL. Historically, Southern blot studies have been considered to be the gold standard for documentation of clonal lymphoid populations. However, Southern blot studies require fresh or frozen tissue and therefore cannot be performed on formalin-fixed, paraffin embedded (FFPE) tissues. PCR studies utilizing primer sets designed by the EuroClonality (BIOMED-2) consortium offer the ability to detect clonal populations with a sensivity approximately equal to that of Southern blot techniques, even from FFPE tissues. Several subtypes of NHL are characterized by specific recurring balanced translocations. These abnormalities may be detected by fluorescence in situ hybridization or, in some cases, by RT-PCR. In general, FISH testing is considered the gold standard for detection of these abnormalities at initial diagnosis. FISH testing for NHL-associated abnormalities can be performed on peripheral blood, bone marrow or FFPE tissues. • FISH for ALK (2p23) Translocations • FISH for BCL2 (18q21.3) Translocations • FISH for BCL6 (3q27) Translocations • FISH for CCND1 (11q13) Translocation • FISH for IGH (14q32) Translocations • FISH for MALT1 (18q21) Translocation • FISH for MYC (8q24) Translocation • FISH for t(11;14) IGH/CCND1 • FISH for t(11;18) API2/MALT1 • FISH for t(14;18) IGH/BCL2 • FISH for t(14;18) IGH/MALT1 • FISH for t(8;14) IGH/MYC • Flow for leukemia/lymphoma • IGH PCR (BIOMED2) • IGH/BCL2 PCR, Qualitative • IGK PCR (BIOMED2) • T-cell clonality (BIOMED2 TCRB+TGRG) • TCRB PCR (BIOMED2) • TCRG PCR (BIOMED2) TCR-G (PCR) Plasma Cell Neoplasms Diagnostic Overview Tests Available Plasma cell myeloma (PCM) is a malignant neoplasm of plasma cells characterized by increased plasma cells in the bone marrow and production of a monoclonal protein in the serum and/or urine. The diagnosis of PCM is based on a combination of clinical findings, bone marrow aspirate and biopsy, and radiographic studies. • FISH for Myeloma The clinical course of PCM is variable, ranging from relatively indolent to very aggressive. FISH studies for recurrent cytogenetic abnormalities, including 13q, 17p-, IGH/CCND1, IGH/MMSET, and IGH/MAF translocations, provide useful prognostic information in PCM. Because the malignant cells of PCM tend to grow poorly in culture, and because some clinically relevant abnormalities may be cryptic by metaphase cytogenetics, FISH analysis is generally preferred for cytogenetic evaluation of PCM. Molecular Hematopathology Cleveland Clinic Laboratories provides comprehensive molecular testing for patients with benign and malignant disorders of the lymph nodes, peripheral blood, and bone marrow. Our state-of-the-art diagnostic techniques assist in establishing a diagnosis, predicting prognosis, and/or guiding the choice of therapy in a wide range of hematologic diseases.

VISA® and MasterCard® are acceptable forms of payment. CPT Coding CPT Codes are provided (in the Test Directory) as a convenience to our clients as guidance to assist you in billing. Since CPT codes are subject to change at any time, it is your responsibility to verify their accuracy for the test performed. For tests that involve several component tests, the Test Directory attempts to provide a comprehensive list of CPT codes for all of the possible components of the test. However, only a subset of component tests may be performed on your specimen. You should verify accuracy of codes listed. When multiple codes are listed, select codes for the tests actually performed on your specimen. Clients are encouraged to consult the CPT Coding Manual published by the American Medical Association and to address questions regarding the use of any particular code to their local Medicare carrier. Cleveland Clinic Laboratories does not assume responsibility for billing errors due to reliance on CPT codes listed in the Test Directory.

Approximately 10 million clinical laboratory test results per year are performed in these laboratories. Specimen Handling Containers Specimens are acceptable for processing only when collected and submitted in the appropriate container. Shipping containers, sterile specimen containers, transport media and swabs are available through Client Services. Specimen containers must be tightened securely to prevent leakage. Labeling Clearly print the patient’s complete name (as listed on the test request form) on the specimen container, culturette, or other specimen transport media. (Labeling of only the outside container is not acceptable). Transport Deliver specimens to the laboratory within 24 hours. Prompt processing minimizes loss in viability of potential pathogens and ensures a more accurate appraisal of flora present. Specimen Rejection Criteria for Microbiology Specimens Client Services will notify the ordering facility or healthcare provider of any test cancellations. Common causes for rejection of microbiology specimens are: Inappropriate specimen for culture requested Improper specimen container or transport media Forms Collection Guidelines: Clean Catch List of Allergens Authorization for Test Add Request General Microbiology Culture Types and Collection Instructions Blood Bacterial Urine Respiratory Stool Misc The detection of microorganisms in blood has great diagnostic and prognostic importance. A completed test request form (particularly time of collection, diagnosis and antimicrobial therapy) is essential for timely and appropriate laboratory processing of the specimen. All routine blood cultures are screened for aerobic and anaerobic bacterial and fungal isolates. All organisms isolated from blood cultures will be identified, susceptibility tests performed, if appropriate, and stock cultures made, unless the isolate is considered a skin contaminant. Stock cultures will be held for 30 days. Organisms that may be contaminants are coagulase-negative Staphylococcus species, Bacillus species, diphtheroid bacilli and viridans Streptococcus species. Blood cultures from patients suspected of having Brucella must be specifically requested as special cultures. (See the individual culture listings of the specific organisms for further details). Guidelines for Drawing Cultures In most adult infections, cultures of two to three separate venipunctures (20-30 mL per venipuncture) are sufficient. Studies have shown the following positive blood culture yields within a 24-hour period in patients without endocarditis: First venipuncture (Set): 80% First and second venipunctures (Set): 90% First, second and third venipunctures (Set): 99% Based on these results, the laboratory will not accept more than four blood culture sets per 24 hours per patient. In suspected acute sepsis, meningitis, osteomyelitis, arthritis or acute untreated bacterial pneumonia, obtain two blood culture sets (from two separate venipuncture sites) before starting therapy. For suspected infective endocarditis. Acute: Obtain three blood culture sets with three separate venipunctures during the first one to two hours of evaluation. Subacute: Obtain three blood culture sets on Day 1 (15 minutes or more apart). If all three are negative at 24 hours, obtain three more. A direct correlation exists between the volume of blood cultured and the recovery rate of clinically significant organisms. For adult patients, each blood culture bottle should receive 10mL of blood. Isolators should receive 10mL as indicated on the tube. For pediatric patients, one to five mL of blood injected into one aerobic blood culture bottle is sufficient. Specimen Collection After placing a tourniquet on the patient's arm, select a suitable vein. Once the vein has been found, cleanse the area with the series of 2% iodine, 70% alcohol, iodine and alcohol. Without touching the site of the venipuncture with the fingers, draw 20mL of blood into a sterile syringe. Inject 10mL of the specimen into each of two culture bottles after cleansing the stoppers with 2% iodine. Invert the containers several times to insure thorough mixture of the contents. (Blood culture systems are available through Client Services). For pediatric patients, write the volume of blood inoculated on the label. Blood cultures from patients suspected of having Histoplasma capsulatum, Brucella, Bartonella, Legionella or Mycobacterium must be specifically requested as special cultures and must be collected in a lysis-centrifugation (Isolator™) tube. (See the individual culture listings of the specific organisms for further details.) Complete a Test Request Form indicating the specific source of the specimen, diagnosis and organism(s) suspected. Label the specimen appropriately. Record the date and time the specimen was collected. Submit specimens in urine culture transport tubes provided by Cleveland Clinic Laboratories. Indicate whether the specimen is from a clean catch or a catheter. Indwelling Catheter Specimen Collection Obtain the specimen with a needle and syringe. Select the puncture site 1-2 inches away from the catheter tube entry point. Cleanse the area to be punctured with 70% alcohol. Aspirate exactly 5mL of urine with a sterile needle and syringe. Disinfect the rubber stopper and aseptically transfer the specimen to the urine transport tube provided. Specimens obtained from the collection bag are not suitable for analysis. Foley tips will not be accepted. Urine Culture Transport Prevention of contamination by normal vaginal, perineal, and anterior urethral flora is the most important consideration for collection of a clinically relevant urine specimen. (See the Patient Collection Guidelines above for collection of a urine specimen). Unpreserved urine is an excellent growth medium for most bacteria. Unless urine is preserved during transport, bacteria may multiply, causing colony counts to be erroneously high. The maintenance medium in the transport kit prevents rapid multiplication of bacteria in the urine during shipment. Instructions for use of urine culture transport system: Obtain the urine specimen from the patient in a clean cup. Open the pouch and remove the transfer device and tube. Submerge the pipette of the transfer device to the bottom of the urine container. The container may be tipped at an angle if the volume of the urine is limited. Place the transport tube in the holder portion of the transfer device and push it down as far as it will go, puncturing the stopper. Hold the tube and transfer device in position until the urine stops flowing into the tube. Remove the transport tube from the transfer device and shake the tube vigorously. Discard the transfer device and remaining cup of urine into appropriate biohazard disposal containers. Precaution: The transport tube must be filled to the minimum line indicated on the tube. A tube that is not filled at least to this line is unacceptable for culture. The following collection sites are considered respiratory specimens: mouth, nose, nasopharyngeal swabs, throat sputum, bronchial and tracheal aspirations, bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and Bartlett Fiberoptic Wimberly (BFW) brush. All specimens from these sites will be screened for fast-growing aerobic pathogenic organisms and for Beta Strep Group A. The following organisms are examples of those not isolated by routine culture: Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Corynebacterium diphtheriae and Bordetella species. Specimens from the nose are the only respiratory specimens routinely screened for Haemophilus species. For information on culture of non-routine organisms, see the culture listing for the specific organism. Refer to the Test Directory for collection information. Specimens must be submitted in transport media provided by the laboratory. Specimens from normally sterile sites (such as body fluids, surgical specimens, joint fluids, etc.) will be cultured for aerobic pathogenic organisms. Anaerobic pathogens may be detected by routine cultures. However, be aware of the special requirements for the isolation of anaerobes. If an anaerobic organism is suspected, a specimen should be submitted for anaerobic culture. Bone marrow, eye swabs, joint fluids and cerebrospinal fluids are routinely screened for fast-growing aerobic pathogenic bacteria including Haemophilus species and pathogenic Neisseria species. Body fluids (exclusive of joint or cerebrospinal fluids) and surgical specimens will be routinely screened for fast-growing aerobic pathogens. Genital tract specimens are tested for Neisseria gonorrhoeae and/or Chlamydia trachomatis by amplification. If Haemophilus ducreyi is suspected, a special request must be made. In cases of suspected toxic shock syndrome, the tentative diagnosis should be placed on the requisition form so that isolates of Staphylococcus aureus may be saved for TSST-1 testing. Vaginal specimens must be accompanied by a request for examination for a specific organism (i.e. group B streptococci, Candida, Trichomonias vaginalis) or for gram stain, which may be examined for the presence of clue cells, curved bacteria, relative proportion of gram-positive bacilli resembling lactobacilli vs. Gram-negative bacilli. Culture for Gardnerella vaginalis is neither sensitive nor specific for the diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis and will not be done. Specimens from wounds, ulcers, and drainages will be screened for nonfastidious, fast-growing aerobic organisms. If an anaerobe is suspected, a specimen must be properly submitted and an anaerobic culture specifically ordered. Nose or Nasopharyngeal Swabs Collect in a manner to avoid contamination by adjacent structures. Throat Specimens Collect in a manner to avoid contamination by mouth and tongue. Throat specimens will be screened for Group A Strep only. Throat specimens for Neisseria ganorrohoeae, Bordetella pertussis or Corynebacterium diphtheriae will be screened only for that pathogen when specifically requested. Collect in a manner to avoid contamination by mouth and tongue. Sputum Specimens Collect by instructing the patient to remove dentures, rinse mouth, gargle with water and cough deeply, expectorating into appropriate collection container. All specimens labeled \"sputum\" that are consistent on cytologic examination with saliva or upper respiratory secretions will be rejected. Rejection or acceptance will be based on microscopic examination for the absence of/or minimal numbers of squamous epithelial cells. Tracheal and Bronchial Aspiration Collect by physician to avoid contamination with adjacent structures. Fungus Provide complete information on the Test Request Form to ensure that the specimen is cultured for all organisms (fungi/yeast) suspected. Additional patient history may be helpful. Include the patient occupation, history of travel or residence abroad, and any animal contacts. A single specimen may be cultured for both bacteria and fungi. Generally, a direct fungal smear exam will be performed on all specimens submitted for fungal cultures. Yeast Requirements are the same as for a fungal culture. Urine, vaginal, throat and stool requests are routinely processed for a yeast culture, even if ordered as a fungal culture. Anaerobes Cultures for fastidious anaerobes will not be performed on urine (nonsuprapubic aspirate) or specimens from body sites that have anaerobes as part of the normal flora (stool, skin, vagina/cervix, mouth, throat, septum, etc.). Any material collected from areas with no normal flora (body fluids, deep abscess exudate, tissue biopsies, transtracheal aspirates, etc.) is acceptable for anaerobic culture. Specimens for anaerobic culture must be collected appropriately and transported in an anaerobic environment (anaerobe vial). Aspirated specimens, in general, are preferred. Swabs are unacceptable for anaerobe culture. Contact Client Services prior to collection of the specimen for consultation on collection procedures, containers, or transport. Acid-Fast Bacillus All cultures and stains for AFB are performed at Cleveland Clinic. Acid-fast stain results are generally available 24-48 hours from receipt of sample. Positive stains and/or culture results are called to the client. Transport specimens in sterile, leak-proof containers and place in appropriate shipping containers. Dry specimens or spilled-leaking specimens are not acceptable for AFB culture. Specimens submitted on swabs or sputums of low volume are discouraged for AFB culture because the yield is significantly decreased. Gastric contents must be neutralized with sodium carbonate or another alkaline buffer salt before transport. Respiratory specimens may be submitted for Mycobacterium tuberculosis amplification. Only specimens that are AFB stain positive are appropriate for testing. An AFB culture and smear should be ordered in conjunction with this request. This test is specific for, but does not differentiate between, members of the M. tuberculosis complex, i.e. M. tuberculosis, M. bovis BCG, M. africanum and M. micrati. A negative test does not exclude the possibility of isolating M. tuberculosis complex from the AFB culture.","url":"laboratory-medicine"},{"title":"Clinical Biochemistry","text":"Clinical Biochemistry provides a broad array of routine and specialized clinical laboratory testing services on blood, urine, and other body fluids.

For questions or additional details regarding the policies and procedures described here, please contact Client Services. Animal Specimens We do not accept animal specimens for laboratory testing. Cancellation of Tests Cancellations received prior to test setup will be honored at no charge. We cannot accommodate cancellation requests received following test setup. A report will be issued automatically and charged as indicated. Compliance Policies Cleveland Clinic Laboratories complies with all applicable laws and regulations such as the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) by developing, implementing and monitoring appropriate policies, procedures and processes. Compliance is overseen by several regulatory agencies, including the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and the Department of Transportation (DOT). Our clients are responsible for their compliance with regulations related to patient confidentiality, diagnosis coding, anti-kick back statutes, professional courtesy, CPT-4 coding, CLIA proficiency testing and other similar regulatory requirements. Analyte Specific Reagents Analyte specific reagents (ASRs) are reagents of chemicals or antibodies that may be considered \"active ingredients\" of tests used to identify specific diseases or conditions. The reagents are purchased by clinical laboratories for use in the development of in-house tests used in the diagnosis and management of various conditions. To meet FDA regulations, the laboratory provides a disclaimer on results from those in- house developed tests that incorporate ASRs. Genetic Testing Ongoing advances in genetic testing and associated regulations frequently require additional patient information and/or documentation of the patient's consent. If required information is not provided at the time of specimen submission, Cleveland Clinic Laboratories will contact the submitting facility to obtain the documentation prior to forwarding the specimen to the testing laboratory. Lead and Heavy Metal Testing State Departments of Health mandate testing laboratories to report specific patient demographics and heavy metal results directly to the state. Cleveland Clinic Laboratories conforms to all such requirements and provides a separate \"Heavy Metals Requisition\" for use by the client when ordering testing for lead, cadmium, arsenic or mercury. Clients must provide all requested information at the time of specimen submission to enable the laboratory to meet these requirements. Required information includes the following: Patient's date of birth, race, complete address, telephone number, sample type (venous or capillary) Guardian's name and phone number (children only) Name and address of patient's place of employment Referring physician's name, address, telephone number and UPIN Specimens received without the required information will not be tested. The client will be contacted and asked to submit the missing information. If such information is not received within one week of specimen submission, the specimen will be discarded. HHS/OIG Compliance Policies Cleveland Clinic Laboratories participates in an active compliance plan, which follows the outline of the Health and Human Services, Office of the Inspector General (HHS/OIG) program. All ordering physicians need to be fully informed and aware of the specific activities associated with the government compliance program and the requirements that include but are not limited to the following practices, policies and procedures: Medicare regulations require only tests that are medically necessary for diagnosis or treatment of a patient may be billed. Each laboratory test request requires appropriate medical necessity (ICD-9 codes). Screening tests (with a few specifically cited exceptions) that are billed to Medicare will be denied reimbursement. Medicare may not pay for non- FDA-approved tests or tests that are identified as \"research use only.\" Each individual test component within the Organ and Disease Related Panels must meet the criteria of medical necessity. If all component tests within a panel do not meet the criteria of medical necessity, a physician should order individual tests or a more appropriate panel. When there is a likelihood that an ordered laboratory test will not be paid by Medicare, the patient should be informed and asked to sign an Advance Beneficiary Notice (ABN), Form No. CMS-R-131-L(June 2001). The signed ABN indicates to the patient the specific test(s) and charge(s) that he/she is responsible for in the event Medicare denies payment. A reflex test is a specific laboratory test in which an abnormal result causes one or more additional tests to be automatically ordered, resulted and billed. The reflex test list is reviewed and approved by Cleveland Clinic's governing administrative bodies annually. All of these tests are also identified in this Cleveland Clinic Laboratories Test Directory. Confidentiality of Results Cleveland Clinic Laboratories is committed to maintaining confidentiality of patient information and to compliance with all privacy, security, and electronic transaction code requirements of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA). All services provided that involve joint efforts will be done in such a way that our clients are compliant with requirements defined by HIPAA and the College of American Pathologists (CAP). To ensure compliance with HIPAA for appropriate release of patient results, we have adopted the following policy: For the laboratory to release information regarding patient results by phone or email, the patient must sign the HIPAA release form. Federal regulations permit the release of results only to ordering physicians or healthcare providers responsible for the individual patient's care. Third parties requesting results, including requests directly from the patient, are directed to the ordering facility. We appreciate your assistance in helping Cleveland Clinic Laboratories preserve patient confidentiality. Critical Result Notification Cleveland Clinic Laboratories will immediately notify the individual who requested a test when any result indicates an imminent, life-threatening condition. This policy is compliance with CLIA regulation 493.1109 (f). Critical values of certain tests will be reported immediately by phone to the client who ordered the test, regardless of the time of day. Infectious Material All specimens are handled as though they are infectious. The greatest dangers to healthcare workers exposed to blood and body fluids are the hepatitis B, hepatitis C and HIV viruses. Cleveland Clinic Reference Laboratories has an extensive safety policy that adheres to guidelines provided by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), the Department of Labor and the Department of Health and Human Services. Written exposure control plans are in place. In addition, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) has listed organisms/diseases that require the use of special packaging and labeling. Shipping regulations require that infectious substances affecting humans be shipped in a special manner. A copy of the regulations is available on the International Air Transport Association website at www.iata.org/ps/publications/issg.htm or by calling 514-399-6770. Physician Name and Number Requests Our goal is always to deliver accurate, high quality, timely results so that diagnostic and treatment decisions can be made as quickly as possible for patient care. At times, Cleveland Clinc Laboratories needs to contact the ordering physician directly, particularly when we are conducting esoteric tests. At times we need the ordering physician's name and phone number to clarify requested services, interpret a test result or otherwise consult with the ordering physician as necessary. If this information was not provided on the test order where indicated, Cleveland Clinic Laboratories may request this information from our client. We appreciate your rapid assistance in supplying us with the ordering physician's name and phone number so that we may contact him or her as needed. Working together, we can provide your patients with the highest quality testing services in the shortest possible time. Proficiency Testing Cleveland Clinic Laboratories has a strict policy regarding proficiency testing (PT) to comply with CMS regulations. The Cleveland Clinic Laboratories will neither accept nor perform testing on proficiency testing material from the College of American Pathologists (CAP) or any other CLIA-approved PT provider. If proficiency testing material is submitted to the Cleveland Clinic Reference Laboratory by a Client and the proficiency testing period is in progress, the samples will be returned and the CAP (our accreditation agency for CLIA certification) will be notified. Additionally, Cleveland Clinic Laboratories will neither communicate nor share with Clients proficiency testing survey results that are actively in progress. Cleveland Clinic will cooperate in alternate assessment programs with other laboratories as allowed by federal regulation. Quality Assurance Extensive proficiency testing and quality control measures assure that each specimen is provided the full benefits of in-house quality, expertise and knowledge. Staff pathologists, PhDs, laboratory scientists and technologists are all highly experienced in handling complex tests. The Quality Coordinating Team and senior management monitor performance indicators for all laboratory services. Performance improvement initiatives are regularly instituted and reviewed as part of an aggressive on-going quality improvement program. Client Services telephone call are monitored and recorded for quality assurance. Radioactive Specimens Cleveland Clinic Laboratories does not routinely test specimens for background radioactivity. This radioactivity may interfere with the results of radioimmunoassasy; therefore, specimens from patients receiving radioactive tracers or material should be labeled as such. Record Retention Cleveland Clinic Laboratories retains all test requisitions for 15 years, and patient test results are retained indefinitely. A copy of the original report can be reconstructed including reference ranges, interpretive comments, flags, and footnotes with the source system as the Pathology and Laboratory Medicine Institute's laboratory information system. Referral Testing Policy Cleveland Clinic Laboratories serves its clients by selecting and using qualified, licensed reference laboratories to perform those tests not available at Cleveland Clinic. Laboratories are identified based on the quality of service provided. Such services include, but are not limited to, accuracy, reliability, turnaround time, customer service, ease of reporting and range of services offered. Clients may, for medical reasons, request that a test be referred to a specific laboratory other than Cleveland Clinic or one which is routinely utilized by Cleveland Clinic Laboratories. Following consultation with the client regarding such requests, Cleveland Clinic Laboratories will honor the client's request and forward the specimen. In the event that Cleveland Clinic Laboratories must refer a test to another laboratory, we invoice for such testing at the price charged to Cleveland Clinic Laboratories plus an administrative fee per test. When a est is referred at the request of the client, a service fee of $30 is charged in addition to the routine administrative fee and the cost of the test. Prices are subject to change without notice. Reflex Testing Some tests, under certain conditions, may result in an order for an additional test(s) placed by and at the discretion of the clinical pathologist. Reflex Testing List Reportable Disease Cleveland Clinic Laboratories strives to comply with state health department requirements regarding reportable diseases. We make our report electronically, by fax or phone, depending upon the individual state's health department regulations. Reports are made to the state listed in the client address. Clients are responsible for compliance with any state-specific statutes concerning reportable conditions, including but not limited to chromosomal abnormality registries. Specimen Containers In response to OSHA standards and good laboratory practices, the laboratory will not accept, transport or test any specimen contained in a syringe with a needle attached. The use of glass tubes, especially for frozen specimens, should be avoided due to the increased risk of broken glass and biological contamination. Acceptable transport tubes are available upon request from Cleveland Clinic Laboratories (contact Client Services). Specimen Labeling All specimens submitted for testing must be labeled with the patient's complete name or identifying number as written on the Test Request Form. This will assure positive identification and optimum integrity of patient specimens from the time of collection until testing has been completed and results reported. Clients will be notified of inappropriately labeled specimens, and the specimen will be returned to the client. Unlabeled or incompletely labeled specimens will not be tested (see Specimen Rejection Criteria below). Specimen Rejection Criteria Specimens will be rejected and the tests and charges canceled under the following conditions: Unlabeled or incompletely labeled specimens Name on specimen does not match name on requisition or electronic order Leaking specimen Broken container Incorrect specimen submitted for test requested Insufficient volume (QNS) Improper specimen transport temperature Age of the specimen (test dependent) Hemolysis (test dependent) Specimens received with no written or electronic order Specimen Volume Specific specimen requirements for each test are provided in the Test Directory. Submit the quantity specified for each test requested. Tests will be canceled as \"QNS\" (Quantity Not Sufficient) when the sample volume is inadequate and will be indicated as such on the report. As a general rule, the volume of blood drawn should equal 2-1/2 times the amount of serum plasma required. For example, to obtain 4mL serum or plasma, draw at least 10mL blood. When inappropriate or insufficient specimens are submitted, the laboratory will store them and contact the requesting facility to request that the specimen be recollected. Documentation of this action will appear on the report. If you have concerns about the volume of a specimen being submitted, please contact Client Services to discuss the test and specimen available. A staff member can advise you whether an alternative technique is available that can accommodate the lesser specimen volume. Test Result Call-Backs Clients may request results to be delivered by telephone. The request for a phone report may be made on the Test Request Form or by calling Cleveland Clinic Laboratories. Time-Sensitive Specimens Please contact Client Services before sending a specimen for testing of a time-sensitive nature. We will ask for the following information: Facility name Account number Patient name and/or Cleveland Clinic Laboratories accession number Shipping information (i.e., courier service, FedEx®, etc.) Date to be sent Test ordered Place specimen in a separate Cleveland Clinic Laboratories temperature-appropriate bag. Turnaround Time (TAT) At Cleveland Clinic our \"Patients First\" philosophy guides every aspect of patient care activities. Through our extensive test menu and commitment to the most rapid TAT possible, Cleveland Clinic Laboratories strives to carry out this commitment to excellent patient care. We define TAT as the analytical test time required. It is monitored closely and compared to standardized laboratory metrics for continuous quality improvement. For more information about TAT for specific tests, please refer to the Test Directory or contact Client Services.","url":"policies-and-procedures"},{"title":"Privacy Policy","text":"Cleveland Clinic Laboratories is committed to protecting your privacy and developing technology that gives you the most powerful and safe online experience.

Shipping containers, sterile specimen containers, transport media and swabs are available through Client Services. Specimen containers must be tightened securely to prevent leakage. Labeling Clearly print the patient’s complete name (as listed on the test request form) on the specimen container, culturette, or other specimen transport media. (Labeling of only the outside container is not acceptable). Transport Deliver specimens to the laboratory within 24 hours. Prompt processing minimizes loss in viability of potential pathogens and ensures a more accurate appraisal of flora present. Specimen Rejection Criteria for Microbiology Specimens Client Services will notify the ordering facility or healthcare provider of any test cancellations. Common causes for rejection of microbiology specimens are: Inappropriate specimen for culture requested Improper specimen container or transport media General Microbiology Culture Types and Collection Instructions Blood The detection of microorganisms in blood has great diagnostic and prognostic importance. A completed test request form (particularly time of collection, diagnosis and antimicrobial therapy) is essential for timely and appropriate laboratory processing of the specimen. All routine blood cultures are screened for aerobic and anaerobic bacterial and fungal isolates. All organisms isolated from blood cultures will be identified, susceptibility tests performed, if appropriate, and stock cultures made, unless the isolate is considered a skin contaminant. Stock cultures will be held for 30 days. Organisms that may be contaminants are coagulase-negative Staphylococcus species, Bacillus species, diphtheroid bacilli and viridans Streptococcus species. Blood cultures from patients suspected of having Brucella must be specifically requested as special cultures. (See the individual culture listings of the specific organisms for further details). Guidelines for Drawing Cultures In most adult infections, cultures of two to three separate venipunctures (20-30 mL per venipuncture) are sufficient. Studies have shown the following positive blood culture yields within a 24-hour period in patients without endocarditis: First venipuncture (Set): 80% First and second venipunctures (Set): 90% First, second and third venipunctures (Set): 99% Based on these results, the laboratory will not accept more than four blood culture sets per 24 hours per patient. In suspected acute sepsis, meningitis, osteomyelitis, arthritis or acute untreated bacterial pneumonia, obtain two blood culture sets (from two separate venipuncture sites) before starting therapy. For suspected infective endocarditis. Acute: Obtain three blood culture sets with three separate venipunctures during the first one to two hours of evaluation. Subacute: Obtain three blood culture sets on Day 1 (15 minutes or more apart). If all three are negative at 24 hours, obtain three more. A direct correlation exists between the volume of blood cultured and the recovery rate of clinically significant organisms. For adult patients, each blood culture bottle should receive 10mL of blood. Isolators should receive 10mL as indicated on the tube. For pediatric patients, one to five mL of blood injected into one aerobic blood culture bottle is sufficient. Specimen Collection After placing a tourniquet on the patient's arm, select a suitable vein. Once the vein has been found, cleanse the area with the series of 2% iodine, 70% alcohol, iodine and alcohol. Without touching the site of the venipuncture with the fingers, draw 20mL of blood into a sterile syringe. Inject 10mL of the specimen into each of two culture bottles after cleansing the stoppers with 2% iodine. Invert the containers several times to insure thorough mixture of the contents. (Blood culture systems are available through Client Services). For pediatric patients, write the volume of blood inoculated on the label. Blood cultures from patients suspected of having Histoplasma capsulatum, Brucella, Bartonella, Legionella or Mycobacterium must be specifically requested as special cultures and must be collected in a lysis-centrifugation (Isolator™) tube. (See the individual culture listings of the specific organisms for further details.) Bacterial Complete a Test Request Form indicating the specific source of the specimen, diagnosis and organism(s) suspected. Label the specimen appropriately. Record the date and time the specimen was collected. Urine Submit specimens in urine culture transport tubes provided by Cleveland Clinic Laboratories. Indicate whether the specimen is from a clean catch or a catheter. Collection Guidelines: Clean Catch Indwelling Catheter Specimen Collection Obtain the specimen with a needle and syringe. Select the puncture site 1-2 inches away from the catheter tube entry point. Cleanse the area to be punctured with 70% alcohol. Aspirate exactly 5mL of urine with a sterile needle and syringe. Disinfect the rubber stopper and aseptically transfer the specimen to the urine transport tube provided. Specimens obtained from the collection bag are not suitable for analysis. Foley tips will not be accepted. Urine Culture Transport Prevention of contamination by normal vaginal, perineal, and anterior urethral flora is the most important consideration for collection of a clinically relevant urine specimen. (See the Patient Collection Guidelines above for collection of a urine specimen). Unpreserved urine is an excellent growth medium for most bacteria. Unless urine is preserved during transport, bacteria may multiply, causing colony counts to be erroneously high. The maintenance medium in the transport kit prevents rapid multiplication of bacteria in the urine during shipment. Instructions for use of urine culture transport system: Obtain the urine specimen from the patient in a clean cup. Open the pouch and remove the transfer device and tube. Submerge the pipette of the transfer device to the bottom of the urine container. The container may be tipped at an angle if the volume of the urine is limited. Place the transport tube in the holder portion of the transfer device and push it down as far as it will go, puncturing the stopper. Hold the tube and transfer device in position until the urine stops flowing into the tube. Remove the transport tube from the transfer device and shake the tube vigorously. Discard the transfer device and remaining cup of urine into appropriate biohazard disposal containers. Precaution: The transport tube must be filled to the minimum line indicated on the tube. A tube that is not filled at least to this line is unacceptable for culture. Respiratory The following collection sites are considered respiratory specimens: mouth, nose, nasopharyngeal swabs, throat sputum, bronchial and tracheal aspirations, bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and Bartlett Fiberoptic Wimberly (BFW) brush. All specimens from these sites will be screened for fast-growing aerobic pathogenic organisms and for Beta Strep Group A. The following organisms are examples of those not isolated by routine culture: Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Corynebacterium diphtheriae and Bordetella species. Specimens from the nose are the only respiratory specimens routinely screened for Haemophilus species. For information on culture of non-routine organisms, see the culture listing for the specific organism. Stool Refer to the Test Directory for collection information. Specimens must be submitted in transport media provided by the laboratory. Miscellaneous Specimens from normally sterile sites (such as body fluids, surgical specimens, joint fluids, etc.) will be cultured for aerobic pathogenic organisms. Anaerobic pathogens may be detected by routine cultures. However, be aware of the special requirements for the isolation of anaerobes. If an anaerobic organism is suspected, a specimen should be submitted for anaerobic culture. Bone marrow, eye swabs, joint fluids and cerebrospinal fluids are routinely screened for fast-growing aerobic pathogenic bacteria including Haemophilus species and pathogenic Neisseria species. Body fluids (exclusive of joint or cerebrospinal fluids) and surgical specimens will be routinely screened for fast-growing aerobic pathogens. Genital tract specimens are tested for Neisseria gonorrhoeae and/or Chlamydia trachomatis by amplification. If Haemophilus ducreyi is suspected, a special request must be made. In cases of suspected toxic shock syndrome, the tentative diagnosis should be placed on the requisition form so that isolates of Staphylococcus aureus may be saved for TSST-1 testing. Vaginal specimens must be accompanied by a request for examination for a specific organism (i.e. group B streptococci, Candida, Trichomonias vaginalis) or for gram stain, which may be examined for the presence of clue cells, curved bacteria, relative proportion of gram-positive bacilli resembling lactobacilli vs. Gram-negative bacilli. Culture for Gardnerella vaginalis is neither sensitive nor specific for the diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis and will not be done. Specimens from wounds, ulcers, and drainages will be screened for nonfastidious, fast-growing aerobic organisms. If an anaerobe is suspected, a specimen must be properly submitted and an anaerobic culture specifically ordered. Nose or Nasopharyngeal Swabs Collect in a manner to avoid contamination by adjacent structures. Throat Specimens Collect in a manner to avoid contamination by mouth and tongue. Throat specimens will be screened for Group A Strep only. Throat specimens for Neisseria ganorrohoeae, Bordetella pertussis or Corynebacterium diphtheriae will be screened only for that pathogen when specifically requested. Collect in a manner to avoid contamination by mouth and tongue. Sputum Specimens Collect by instructing the patient to remove dentures, rinse mouth, gargle with water and cough deeply, expectorating into appropriate collection container. All specimens labeled \"sputum\" that are consistent on cytologic examination with saliva or upper respiratory secretions will be rejected. Rejection or acceptance will be based on microscopic examination for the absence of/or minimal numbers of squamous epithelial cells. Tracheal and Bronchial Aspiration Collect by physician to avoid contamination with adjacent structures. Fungus Provide complete information on the Test Request Form to ensure that the specimen is cultured for all organisms (fungi/yeast) suspected. Additional patient history may be helpful. Include the patient occupation, history of travel or residence abroad, and any animal contacts. A single specimen may be cultured for both bacteria and fungi. Generally, a direct fungal smear exam will be performed on all specimens submitted for fungal cultures. Yeast Requirements are the same as for a fungal culture. Urine, vaginal, throat and stool requests are routinely processed for a yeast culture, even if ordered as a fungal culture. Anaerobes Cultures for fastidious anaerobes will not be performed on urine (nonsuprapubic aspirate) or specimens from body sites that have anaerobes as part of the normal flora (stool, skin, vagina/cervix, mouth, throat, septum, etc.). Any material collected from areas with no normal flora (body fluids, deep abscess exudate, tissue biopsies, transtracheal aspirates, etc.) is acceptable for anaerobic culture. Specimens for anaerobic culture must be collected appropriately and transported in an anaerobic environment (anaerobe vial). Aspirated specimens, in general, are preferred. Swabs are unacceptable for anaerobe culture. Contact Client Services prior to collection of the specimen for consultation on collection procedures, containers, or transport. Acid-Fast Bacillus All cultures and stains for AFB are performed at Cleveland Clinic. Acid-fast stain results are generally available 24-48 hours from receipt of sample. Positive stains and/or culture results are called to the client. Transport specimens in sterile, leak-proof containers and place in appropriate shipping containers. Dry specimens or spilled-leaking specimens are not acceptable for AFB culture. Specimens submitted on swabs or sputums of low volume are discouraged for AFB culture because the yield is significantly decreased. Gastric contents must be neutralized with sodium carbonate or another alkaline buffer salt before transport. Respiratory specimens may be submitted for Mycobacterium tuberculosis amplification. Only specimens that are AFB stain positive are appropriate for testing. An AFB culture and smear should be ordered in conjunction with this request. This test is specific for, but does not differentiate between, members of the M. tuberculosis complex, i.e. M. tuberculosis, M. bovis BCG, M. africanum and M. micrati. A negative test does not exclude the possibility of isolating M. tuberculosis complex from the AFB culture.","url":"specimen-collection-handling-instructions"},{"title":"Subspecialty Consultative Services","text":"Cleveland Clinic offers second opinion reviews for surgical, cytology and hematopathology cases.
