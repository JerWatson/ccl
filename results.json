Approximately 10 million clinical laboratory test results per year are performed in these laboratories. Specimen Handling Containers Specimens are acceptable for processing only when collected and submitted in the appropriate container. Shipping containers, sterile specimen containers, transport media and swabs are available through Client Services. Specimen containers must be tightened securely to prevent leakage. Labeling Clearly print the patient’s complete name (as listed on the test request form) on the specimen container, culturette, or other specimen transport media. (Labeling of only the outside container is not acceptable). Transport Deliver specimens to the laboratory within 24 hours. Prompt processing minimizes loss in viability of potential pathogens and ensures a more accurate appraisal of flora present. Specimen Rejection Criteria for Microbiology Specimens Client Services will notify the ordering facility or healthcare provider of any test cancellations. Common causes for rejection of microbiology specimens are: Inappropriate specimen for culture requested Improper specimen container or transport media Inappropriate specimen for culture requested Improper specimen container or transport media Forms Collection Guidelines: Clean Catch List of Allergens Authorization for Test Add Request Collection Guidelines: Clean Catch List of Allergens Authorization for Test Add Request General Microbiology Culture Types and Collection Instructions Blood Bacterial Urine Respiratory Stool Misc Blood Bacterial Urine Respiratory Stool Misc The detection of microorganisms in blood has great diagnostic and prognostic importance. A completed test request form (particularly time of collection, diagnosis and antimicrobial therapy) is essential for timely and appropriate laboratory processing of the specimen. All routine blood cultures are screened for aerobic and anaerobic bacterial and fungal isolates. All organisms isolated from blood cultures will be identified, susceptibility tests performed, if appropriate, and stock cultures made, unless the isolate is considered a skin contaminant. Stock cultures will be held for 30 days. Organisms that may be contaminants are coagulase negative Staphylococcus species, Bacillus species, diphtheroid bacilli and viridans Streptococcus species. Blood cultures from patients suspected of having Brucella must be specifically requested as special cultures. (See the individual culture listings of the specific organisms for further details). Guidelines for Drawing Cultures In most adult infections, cultures of two to three separate venipunctures (20-30 mL per venipuncture) are sufficient. Studies have shown the following positive blood culture yields within a 24-hour period in patients without endocarditis: First venipuncture (Set): 80% First and second venipunctures (Set): 90% First, second and third venipunctures (Set): 99% Based on these results, the laboratory will not accept more than four blood culture sets per 24 hours per patient. In suspected acute sepsis, meningitis, osteomyelitis, arthritis or acute untreated bacterial pneumonia, obtain two blood culture sets (from two separate venipuncture sites) before starting therapy. For suspected infective endocarditis. Acute: Obtain three blood culture sets with three separate venipunctures during the first one to two hours of evaluation. Subacute: Obtain three blood culture sets on Day 1 (15 minutes or more apart). If all three are negative at 24 hours, obtain three more. A direct correlation exists between the volume of blood cultured and the recovery rate of clinically significant organisms. For adult patients, each blood culture bottle should receive 10mL of blood. Isolators should receive 10mL as indicated on the tube. For pediatric patients, one to five mL of blood injected into one aerobic blood culture bottle is sufficient. Specimen Collection After placing a tourniquet on the patient's arm, select a suitable vein. Once the vein has been found, cleanse the area with the series of 2% iodine, 70% alcohol, iodine and alcohol. Without touching the site of the venipuncture with the fingers, draw 20mL of blood into a sterile syringe. Inject 10mL of the specimen into each of two culture bottles after cleansing the stoppers with 2% iodine. Invert the containers several times to insure thorough mixture of the contents. (Blood culture systems are available through Client Services). For pediatric patients, write the volume of blood inoculated on the label. Blood cultures from patients suspected of having Histoplasma capsulatum, Brucella, Bartonella, Legionella or Mycobacterium must be specifically requested as special cultures and must be collected in a lysis-centrifugation (Isolator™) tube. (See the individual culture listings of the specific organisms for further details.) Complete a Test Request Form indicating the specific source of the specimen, diagnosis and organism(s) suspected. Label the specimen appropriately. Record the date and time the specimen was collected. Submit specimens in urine culture transport tubes provided by Cleveland Clinic Laboratories. Indicate whether the specimen is from a clean catch or a catheter. Indwelling Catheter Specimen Collection Obtain the specimen with a needle and syringe. Select the puncture site 1-2 inches away from the catheter tube entry point. Cleanse the area to be punctured with 70% alcohol. Aspirate exactly 5mL of urine with a sterile needle and syringe. Disinfect the rubber stopper and aseptically transfer the specimen to the urine transport tube provided. Specimens obtained from the collection bag are not suitable for analysis. Foley tips will not be accepted. Urine Culture Transport Prevention of contamination by normal vaginal, perineal, and anterior urethral flora is the most important consideration for collection of a clinically relevant urine specimen. (See the Patient Collection Guidelines above for collection of a urine specimen). Unpreserved urine is an excellent growth medium for most bacteria. Unless urine is preserved during transport, bacteria may multiply, causing colony counts to be erroneously high. The maintenance medium in the transport kit prevents rapid multiplication of bacteria in the urine during shipment. Instructions for use of urine culture transport system: Obtain the urine specimen from the patient in a clean cup. Open the pouch and remove the transfer device and tube. Submerge the pipette of the transfer device to the bottom of the urine container. The container may be tipped at an angle if the volume of the urine is limited. Place the transport tube in the holder portion of the transfer device and push it down as far as it will go, puncturing the stopper. Hold the tube and transfer device in position until the urine stops flowing into the tube. Remove the transport tube from the transfer device and shake the tube vigorously. Discard the transfer device and remaining cup of urine into appropriate biohazard disposal containers. Precaution: The transport tube must be filled to the minimum line indicated on the tube. A tube that is not filled at least to this line is unacceptable for culture. The following collection sites are considered respiratory specimens: mouth, nose, nasopharyngeal swabs, throat sputum, bronchial and tracheal aspirations, bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and Bartlett Fiberoptic Wimberly (BFW) brush. All specimens from these sites will be screened for fast-growing aerobic pathogenic organisms and for Beta Strep Group A. The following organisms are examples of those not isolated by routine culture: Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Corynebacterium diphtheriae and Bordetella species. Specimens from the nose are the only respiratory specimens routinely screened for Haemophilus species. For information on culture of non-routine organisms, see the culture listing for the specific organism. Refer to the Test Directory for collection information. Specimens must be submitted in transport media provided by the laboratory. Specimens from normally sterile sites (such as body fluids, surgical specimens, joint fluids, etc.) will be cultured for aerobic pathogenic organisms. Anaerobic pathogens may be detected by routine cultures. However, be aware of the special requirements for the isolation of anaerobes. If an anaerobic organism is suspected, a specimen should be submitted for anaerobic culture. Bone marrow, eye swabs, joint fluids and cerebrospinal fluids are routinely screened for fast-growing aerobic pathogenic bacteria including Haemophilus species and pathogenic Neisseria species. Body fluids (exclusive of joint or cerebrospinal fluids) and surgical specimens will be routinely screened for fast-growing aerobic pathogens. Genital tract specimens are tested for Neisseria gonorrhoeae and/or Chlamydia trachomatis by amplification. If Haemophilus ducreyi is suspected, a special request must be made. In cases of suspected toxic shock syndrome, the tentative diagnosis should be placed on the requisition form so that isolates of Staphylococcus aureus may be saved for TSST-1 testing. Vaginal specimens must be accompanied by a request for examination for a specific organism (i.e. group B streptococci, Candida, Trichomonias vaginalis) or for gram stain, which may be examined for the presence of clue cells, curved bacteria, relative proportion of gram-positive bacilli resembling lactobacilli vs. Gram-negative bacilli. Culture for Gardnerella vaginalis is neither sensitive nor specific for the diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis and will not be done. Specimens from wounds, ulcers, and drainages will be screened for nonfastidious, fast-growing aerobic organisms. If an anaerobe is suspected, a specimen must be properly submitted and an anaerobic culture specifically ordered. Nose or Nasopharyngeal Swabs Collect in a manner to avoid contamination by adjacent structures. Throat Specimens Collect in a manner to avoid contamination by mouth and tongue. Throat specimens will be screened for Group A Strep only. Throat specimens for Neisseria ganorrohoeae, Bordetella pertussis or Corynebacterium diphtheriae will be screened only for that pathogen when specifically requested. Collect in a manner to avoid contamination by mouth and tongue. Sputum Specimens Collect by instructing the patient to remove dentures, rinse mouth, gargle with water and cough deeply, expectorating into appropriate collection container. All specimens labeled \"sputum\" that are consistent on cytologic examination with saliva or upper respiratory secretions will be rejected. Rejection or acceptance will be based on microscopic examination for the absence of/or minimal numbers of squamous epithelial cells. Tracheal and Bronchial Aspiration Collect by physician to avoid contamination with adjacent structures. Fungus Provide complete information on the Test Request Form to ensure that the specimen is cultured for all organisms (fungi/yeast) suspected. Additional patient history may be helpful. Include the patient occupation, history of travel or residence abroad, and any animal contacts. A single specimen may be cultured for both bacteria and fungi. Generally, a direct fungal smear exam will be performed on all specimens submitted for fungal cultures. Yeast Requirements are the same as for a fungal culture. Urine, vaginal, throat and stool requests are routinely processed for a yeast culture, even if ordered as a fungal culture. Anaerobes Cultures for fastidious anaerobes will not be performed on urine (nonsuprapubic aspirate) or specimens from body sites that have anaerobes as part of the normal flora (stool, skin, vagina/cervix, mouth, throat, septum, etc.). Any material collected from areas with no normal flora (body fluids, deep abscess exudate, tissue biopsies, transtracheal aspirates, etc.) is acceptable for anaerobic culture. Specimens for anaerobic culture must be collected appropriately and transported in an anaerobic environment (anaerobe vial). Aspirated specimens, in general, are preferred. Swabs are unacceptable for anaerobe culture. Contact Client Services prior to collection of the specimen for consultation on collection procedures, containers, or transport. Acid-Fast Bacillus All cultures and stains for AFB are performed at Cleveland Clinic. Acid-fast stain results are generally available 24-48 hours from receipt of sample. Positive stains and/or culture results are called to the client. Transport specimens in sterile, leak-proof containers and place in appropriate shipping containers. Dry specimens or spilled-leaking specimens are not acceptable for AFB culture. Specimens submitted on swabs or sputums of low volume are discouraged for AFB culture because the yield is significantly decreased. Gastric contents must be neutralized with sodium carbonate or another alkaline buffer salt before transport. Respiratory specimens may be submitted for Mycobacterium tuberculosis amplification. Only specimens that are AFB stain positive are appropriate for testing. An AFB culture and smear should be ordered in conjunction with this request. This test is specific for, but does not differentiate between, members of the M. tuberculosis complex, i.e. M. tuberculosis, M. bovis BCG, M. africanum and M. micrati. A negative test does not exclude the possibility of isolating M. tuberculosis complex from the AFB culture. The detection of microorganisms in blood has great diagnostic and prognostic importance. A completed test request form (particularly time of collection, diagnosis and antimicrobial therapy) is essential for timely and appropriate laboratory processing of the specimen. All routine blood cultures are screened for aerobic and anaerobic bacterial and fungal isolates. All organisms isolated from blood cultures will be identified, susceptibility tests performed, if appropriate, and stock cultures made, unless the isolate is considered a skin contaminant. Stock cultures will be held for 30 days. Organisms that may be contaminants are coagulase negative Staphylococcus species, Bacillus species, diphtheroid bacilli and viridans Streptococcus species. Blood cultures from patients suspected of having Brucella must be specifically requested as special cultures. (See the individual culture listings of the specific organisms for further details). Guidelines for Drawing Cultures In most adult infections, cultures of two to three separate venipunctures (20-30 mL per venipuncture) are sufficient. Studies have shown the following positive blood culture yields within a 24-hour period in patients without endocarditis: First venipuncture (Set): 80% First and second venipunctures (Set): 90% First, second and third venipunctures (Set): 99% Based on these results, the laboratory will not accept more than four blood culture sets per 24 hours per patient. In suspected acute sepsis, meningitis, osteomyelitis, arthritis or acute untreated bacterial pneumonia, obtain two blood culture sets (from two separate venipuncture sites) before starting therapy. For suspected infective endocarditis. Acute: Obtain three blood culture sets with three separate venipunctures during the first one to two hours of evaluation. Subacute: Obtain three blood culture sets on Day 1 (15 minutes or more apart). If all three are negative at 24 hours, obtain three more. A direct correlation exists between the volume of blood cultured and the recovery rate of clinically significant organisms. For adult patients, each blood culture bottle should receive 10mL of blood. Isolators should receive 10mL as indicated on the tube. For pediatric patients, one to five mL of blood injected into one aerobic blood culture bottle is sufficient. Specimen Collection After placing a tourniquet on the patient's arm, select a suitable vein. Once the vein has been found, cleanse the area with the series of 2% iodine, 70% alcohol, iodine and alcohol. Without touching the site of the venipuncture with the fingers, draw 20mL of blood into a sterile syringe. Inject 10mL of the specimen into each of two culture bottles after cleansing the stoppers with 2% iodine. Invert the containers several times to insure thorough mixture of the contents. (Blood culture systems are available through Client Services). For pediatric patients, write the volume of blood inoculated on the label. Blood cultures from patients suspected of having Histoplasma capsulatum, Brucella, Bartonella, Legionella or Mycobacterium must be specifically requested as special cultures and must be collected in a lysis-centrifugation (Isolator™) tube. (See the individual culture listings of the specific organisms for further details.) The detection of microorganisms in blood has great diagnostic and prognostic importance. A completed test request form (particularly time of collection, diagnosis and antimicrobial therapy) is essential for timely and appropriate laboratory processing of the specimen. All routine blood cultures are screened for aerobic and anaerobic bacterial and fungal isolates. All organisms isolated from blood cultures will be identified, susceptibility tests performed, if appropriate, and stock cultures made, unless the isolate is considered a skin contaminant. Stock cultures will be held for 30 days. Organisms that may be contaminants are coagulase negative Staphylococcus species, Bacillus species, diphtheroid bacilli and viridans Streptococcus species.

Label the specimen appropriately. Record the date and time the specimen was collected. Submit specimens in urine culture transport tubes provided by Cleveland Clinic Laboratories. Indicate whether the specimen is from a clean catch or a catheter. Indwelling Catheter Specimen Collection Obtain the specimen with a needle and syringe. Select the puncture site 1 2 inches away from the catheter tube entry point. Cleanse the area to be punctured with 70% alcohol. Aspirate exactly 5mL of urine with a sterile needle and syringe. Disinfect the rubber stopper and aseptically transfer the specimen to the urine transport tube provided. Specimens obtained from the collection bag are not suitable for analysis. Foley tips will not be accepted. Urine Culture Transport Prevention of contamination by normal vaginal, perineal, and anterior urethral flora is the most important consideration for collection of a clinically relevant urine specimen. (See the Patient Collection Guidelines above for collection of a urine specimen). Unpreserved urine is an excellent growth medium for most bacteria. Unless urine is preserved during transport, bacteria may multiply, causing colony counts to be erroneously high. The maintenance medium in the transport kit prevents rapid multiplication of bacteria in the urine during shipment. Instructions for use of urine culture transport system: Obtain the urine specimen from the patient in a clean cup. Open the pouch and remove the transfer device and tube. Submerge the pipette of the transfer device to the bottom of the urine container. The container may be tipped at an angle if the volume of the urine is limited. Place the transport tube in the holder portion of the transfer device and push it down as far as it will go, puncturing the stopper. Hold the tube and transfer device in position until the urine stops flowing into the tube. Remove the transport tube from the transfer device and shake the tube vigorously. Discard the transfer device and remaining cup of urine into appropriate biohazard disposal containers. Precaution: The transport tube must be filled to the minimum line indicated on the tube. A tube that is not filled at least to this line is unacceptable for culture. Submit specimens in urine culture transport tubes provided by Cleveland Clinic Laboratories.

Specimens must be submitted in transport media provided by the laboratory. Test Directory Specimens from normally sterile sites (such as body fluids, surgical specimens, joint fluids, etc.) will be cultured for aerobic pathogenic organisms. Anaerobic pathogens may be detected by routine cultures. However, be aware of the special requirements for the isolation of anaerobes. If an anaerobic organism is suspected, a specimen should be submitted for anaerobic culture. Bone marrow, eye swabs, joint fluids and cerebrospinal fluids are routinely screened for fast growing aerobic pathogenic bacteria including Haemophilus species and pathogenic Neisseria species. Body fluids (exclusive of joint or cerebrospinal fluids) and surgical specimens will be routinely screened for fast-growing aerobic pathogens. Genital tract specimens are tested for Neisseria gonorrhoeae and/or Chlamydia trachomatis by amplification. If Haemophilus ducreyi is suspected, a special request must be made. In cases of suspected toxic shock syndrome, the tentative diagnosis should be placed on the requisition form so that isolates of Staphylococcus aureus may be saved for TSST-1 testing. Vaginal specimens must be accompanied by a request for examination for a specific organism (i.e. group B streptococci, Candida, Trichomonias vaginalis) or for gram stain, which may be examined for the presence of clue cells, curved bacteria, relative proportion of gram-positive bacilli resembling lactobacilli vs. Gram-negative bacilli. Culture for Gardnerella vaginalis is neither sensitive nor specific for the diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis and will not be done. Specimens from wounds, ulcers, and drainages will be screened for nonfastidious, fast-growing aerobic organisms. If an anaerobe is suspected, a specimen must be properly submitted and an anaerobic culture specifically ordered. Nose or Nasopharyngeal Swabs Collect in a manner to avoid contamination by adjacent structures. Throat Specimens Collect in a manner to avoid contamination by mouth and tongue. Throat specimens will be screened for Group A Strep only. Throat specimens for Neisseria ganorrohoeae, Bordetella pertussis or Corynebacterium diphtheriae will be screened only for that pathogen when specifically requested. Collect in a manner to avoid contamination by mouth and tongue. Sputum Specimens Collect by instructing the patient to remove dentures, rinse mouth, gargle with water and cough deeply, expectorating into appropriate collection container. All specimens labeled \"sputum\" that are consistent on cytologic examination with saliva or upper respiratory secretions will be rejected. Rejection or acceptance will be based on microscopic examination for the absence of/or minimal numbers of squamous epithelial cells. Tracheal and Bronchial Aspiration Collect by physician to avoid contamination with adjacent structures. Fungus Provide complete information on the Test Request Form to ensure that the specimen is cultured for all organisms (fungi/yeast) suspected. Additional patient history may be helpful. Include the patient occupation, history of travel or residence abroad, and any animal contacts. A single specimen may be cultured for both bacteria and fungi. Generally, a direct fungal smear exam will be performed on all specimens submitted for fungal cultures. Yeast Requirements are the same as for a fungal culture. Urine, vaginal, throat and stool requests are routinely processed for a yeast culture, even if ordered as a fungal culture. Anaerobes Cultures for fastidious anaerobes will not be performed on urine (nonsuprapubic aspirate) or specimens from body sites that have anaerobes as part of the normal flora (stool, skin, vagina/cervix, mouth, throat, septum, etc.). Any material collected from areas with no normal flora (body fluids, deep abscess exudate, tissue biopsies, transtracheal aspirates, etc.) is acceptable for anaerobic culture. Specimens for anaerobic culture must be collected appropriately and transported in an anaerobic environment (anaerobe vial). Aspirated specimens, in general, are preferred. Swabs are unacceptable for anaerobe culture. Contact Client Services prior to collection of the specimen for consultation on collection procedures, containers, or transport. Acid-Fast Bacillus All cultures and stains for AFB are performed at Cleveland Clinic. Acid-fast stain results are generally available 24-48 hours from receipt of sample. Positive stains and/or culture results are called to the client. Transport specimens in sterile, leak-proof containers and place in appropriate shipping containers. Dry specimens or spilled-leaking specimens are not acceptable for AFB culture. Specimens submitted on swabs or sputums of low volume are discouraged for AFB culture because the yield is significantly decreased. Gastric contents must be neutralized with sodium carbonate or another alkaline buffer salt before transport. Respiratory specimens may be submitted for Mycobacterium tuberculosis amplification. Only specimens that are AFB stain positive are appropriate for testing. An AFB culture and smear should be ordered in conjunction with this request. This test is specific for, but does not differentiate between, members of the M. tuberculosis complex, i.e. M. tuberculosis, M. bovis BCG, M. africanum and M. micrati. A negative test does not exclude the possibility of isolating M. tuberculosis complex from the AFB culture.

VISA® and MasterCard® are acceptable forms of payment. CPT Coding CPT Codes are provided (in the Test Directory) as a convenience to our clients as guidance to assist you in billing. Since CPT codes are subject to change at any time, it is your responsibility to verify their accuracy for the test performed. For tests that involve several component tests, the Test Directory attempts to provide a comprehensive list of CPT codes for all of the possible components of the test. However, only a subset of component tests may be performed on your specimen. You should verify accuracy of codes listed. When multiple codes are listed, select codes for the tests actually performed on your specimen. Clients are encouraged to consult the CPT Coding Manual published by the American Medical Association and to address questions regarding the use of any particular code to their local Medicare carrier. Cleveland Clinic Laboratories does not assume responsibility for billing errors due to reliance on CPT codes listed in the Test Directory.

Chromosome disorders, a major category of genetic disease, are caused by errors in the number or structure in one or more genes, resulting in congenital malformations, developmental delay/intellectual disability, infertility and other abnormalities. In addition to the study of these disorders, cytogenetics has become an important tool in the diagnosis of patients with hematologic/oncologic disorders, and is used for disease classification, treatment decisions, and to monitor disease status and recovery. The Molecular Cytogenetics Laboratory, a section of the Department of Molecular Pathology, includes staff members with expertise in cytogenetics and molecular genetic pathology. Together with our cytogenetics medical technologists and genetic counselor, this team is committed to providing the highest quality cytogenetic analysis available to complement your clinical practice. Accuracy, quality, reliable turnaround time, expert staff, and genetic counseling are all significant features of our program. Cytogenetic studies include traditional techniques for neoplastic disorders, solid tumors and congenital disorders. In addition, high resolution chromosome analysis and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) are available on a variety of specimen types, including peripheral blood, bone marrow and tissue investigations. Chromosomal microarray is the latest technology to be added in our laboratory and is currently offered as a first-tier test in various pediatric indications including multiple congenital anomalies, intellectual disability and autism spectrum disorders.

Our Section strives to provide molecular tests for a full range of indications spanning inherited and genetic disorders to pharmacogenomics including preventive, diagnostic, prognostic, therapeutic or predictive drug (safety and efficacy) use. In most instances, in house assays are developed and validated, and testing methodologies are improved for clinical use. State-of-the-art molecular techniques and technology for nucleic acid sequencing include polymerase chain reaction (PCR), real-time PCR, GeneScan® and sequencing by capillary electrophoresis, with next-generation sequencing and bead array to be added in the near future. In addition to standard-of-care tests, the MGP Laboratory actively promotes translational research and seeks opportunities to collaborate with clinical and research experts in areas of interest. Ultimately, MGP complements the efforts of the Department of Molecular Pathology in attaining excellence in patient care and service, education and research. Test Development Tests to be in sourced and developed are prioritized drawing from consultative meetings with clinical specialists, current test utilization patterns at Cleveland Clinic, and the commercial availability of DNA/RNA-based clinical laboratory tests. For each molecular test, considerations include clinical utility, ease of test adoption and test validation. In addition to its offerings and testing for more common genetic disorders, the MGP Section recognizes the value of developing tests for select rare conditions for which testing is not widely available. In-sourcing molecular tests not only facilitates access to laboratory experts but translates to significant cost savings from reducing test send-outs and decreased the turn-around time, which potentially improves the time-to-diagnosis and treatment resulting in reduced length of hospital stay and decreased disease morbidity. In the past year, the MGP Section validated two sequencing based assays, VWF exon 28 (von Willebrand disease type 2) and TTR (familial transthyretin amyloidosis). Other recently validated tests include PCR with fragment length analysis for FMR1-related disorders (fragile X syndrome, fragile X- associated tremor/ataxia syndrome and FMR1-related premature ovarian insufficiency) and SERPINA1 (alpha-1-antitrypsin) mutation screen. The transfer of these tests from our development core to laboratory operations is under way. The feasibility and logistics of DNA extraction, storage, retrieval and reporting are currently being addressed. Additional molecular diagnostic tests are in the pipeline. Test Utilization The MGP Laboratory encourages appropriate utilization of nucleic acid based tests in the molecular diagnosis of genetic disorders for patients from various specialties of medicine.

This policy is compliance with CLIA regulation 493.1109 (f). Critical values of certain tests will be reported immediately by phone to the client who ordered the test, regardless of the time of day. Infectious Material All specimens are handled as though they are infectious. The greatest dangers to healthcare workers exposed to blood and body fluids are the hepatitis B, hepatitis C and HIV viruses. Cleveland Clinic Reference Laboratories has an extensive safety policy that adheres to guidelines provided by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), the Department of Labor and the Department of Health and Human Services. Written exposure control plans are in place. In addition, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) has listed organisms/diseases that require the use of special packaging and labeling. Shipping regulations require that infectious substances affecting humans be shipped in a special manner. A copy of the regulations is available on the International Air Transport Association website at www.iata.org/ps/publications/issg.htm or by calling 514 399-6770. www.iata.org/ps/publications/issg.htm Physician Name and Number Requests Our goal is always to deliver accurate, high quality, timely results so that diagnostic and treatment decisions can be made as quickly as possible for patient care. At times, Cleveland Clinc Laboratories needs to contact the ordering physician directly, particularly when we are conducting esoteric tests. At times we need the ordering physician's name and phone number to clarify requested services, interpret a test result or otherwise consult with the ordering physician as necessary. If this information was not provided on the test order where indicated, Cleveland Clinic Laboratories may request this information from our client. We appreciate your rapid assistance in supplying us with the ordering physician's name and phone number so that we may contact him or her as needed. Working together, we can provide your patients with the highest quality testing services in the shortest possible time. Proficiency Testing Cleveland Clinic Laboratories has a strict policy regarding proficiency testing (PT) to comply with CMS regulations. The Cleveland Clinic Laboratories will neither accept nor perform testing on proficiency testing material from the College of American Pathologists (CAP) or any other CLIA approved PT provider. If proficiency testing material is submitted to the Cleveland Clinic Reference Laboratory by a Client and the proficiency testing period is in progress, the samples will be returned and the CAP (our accreditation agency for CLIA certification) will be notified. Additionally, Cleveland Clinic Laboratories will neither communicate nor share with Clients proficiency testing survey results that are actively in progress. Cleveland Clinic will cooperate in alternate assessment programs with other laboratories as allowed by federal regulation. Quality Assurance Extensive proficiency testing and quality control measures assure that each specimen is provided the full benefits of in house quality, expertise and knowledge. Staff pathologists, PhDs, laboratory scientists and technologists are all highly experienced in handling complex tests. The Quality Coordinating Team and senior management monitor performance indicators for all laboratory services. Performance improvement initiatives are regularly instituted and reviewed as part of an aggressive on-going quality improvement program. Client Services telephone call are monitored and recorded for quality assurance. Radioactive Specimens Cleveland Clinic Laboratories does not routinely test specimens for background radioactivity. This radioactivity may interfere with the results of radioimmunoassasy; therefore, specimens from patients receiving radioactive tracers or material should be labeled as such. Record Retention Cleveland Clinic Laboratories retains all test requisitions for 15 years, and patient test results are retained indefinitely. A copy of the original report can be reconstructed including reference ranges, interpretive comments, flags, and footnotes with the source system as the Pathology and Laboratory Medicine Institute's laboratory information system. Referral Testing Policy Cleveland Clinic Laboratories serves its clients by selecting and using qualified, licensed reference laboratories to perform those tests not available at Cleveland Clinic. Laboratories are identified based on the quality of service provided. Such services include, but are not limited to, accuracy, reliability, turnaround time, customer service, ease of reporting and range of services offered. Clients may, for medical reasons, request that a test be referred to a specific laboratory other than Cleveland Clinic or one which is routinely utilized by Cleveland Clinic Laboratories. Following consultation with the client regarding such requests, Cleveland Clinic Laboratories will honor the client's request and forward the specimen. In the event that Cleveland Clinic Laboratories must refer a test to another laboratory, we invoice for such testing at the price charged to Cleveland Clinic Laboratories plus an administrative fee per test. When a est is referred at the request of the client, a service fee of $30 is charged in addition to the routine administrative fee and the cost of the test. Prices are subject to change without notice. Reflex Testing Some tests, under certain conditions, may result in an order for an additional test(s) placed by and at the discretion of the clinical pathologist. Reflex Testing List Reportable Disease Cleveland Clinic Laboratories strives to comply with state health department requirements regarding reportable diseases. We make our report electronically, by fax or phone, depending upon the individual state's health department regulations. Reports are made to the state listed in the client address. Clients are responsible for compliance with any state specific statutes concerning reportable conditions, including but not limited to chromosomal abnormality registries. Specimen Containers In response to OSHA standards and good laboratory practices, the laboratory will not accept, transport or test any specimen contained in a syringe with a needle attached. The use of glass tubes, especially for frozen specimens, should be avoided due to the increased risk of broken glass and biological contamination. Acceptable transport tubes are available upon request from Cleveland Clinic Laboratories (contact Client Services). Client Services Specimen Labeling All specimens submitted for testing must be labeled with the patient's complete name or identifying number as written on the Test Request Form. This will assure positive identification and optimum integrity of patient specimens from the time of collection until testing has been completed and results reported. Clients will be notified of inappropriately labeled specimens, and the specimen will be returned to the client. Unlabeled or incompletely labeled specimens will not be tested (see Specimen Rejection Criteria below). Specimen Rejection Criteria Specimens will be rejected and the tests and charges canceled under the following conditions: Unlabeled or incompletely labeled specimens Name on specimen does not match name on requisition or electronic order Leaking specimen Broken container Incorrect specimen submitted for test requested Insufficient volume (QNS) Improper specimen transport temperature Age of the specimen (test dependent) Hemolysis (test dependent) Specimens received with no written or electronic order Unlabeled or incompletely labeled specimens Name on specimen does not match name on requisition or electronic order Leaking specimen Broken container Incorrect specimen submitted for test requested Insufficient volume (QNS) Improper specimen transport temperature Age of the specimen (test dependent) Hemolysis (test dependent) Specimens received with no written or electronic order Specimen Volume Specific specimen requirements for each test are provided in the Test Directory. Submit the quantity specified for each test requested. Tests will be canceled as \"QNS\" (Quantity Not Sufficient) when the sample volume is inadequate and will be indicated as such on the report. As a general rule, the volume of blood drawn should equal 2 1/2 times the amount of serum plasma required. For example, to obtain 4mL serum or plasma, draw at least 10mL blood. When inappropriate or insufficient specimens are submitted, the laboratory will store them and contact the requesting facility to request that the specimen be recollected. Documentation of this action will appear on the report. If you have concerns about the volume of a specimen being submitted, please contact Client Services to discuss the test and specimen available. A staff member can advise you whether an alternative technique is available that can accommodate the lesser specimen volume. Test Result Call Backs Clients may request results to be delivered by telephone. The request for a phone report may be made on the Test Request Form or by calling Cleveland Clinic Laboratories. Time Sensitive Specimens Please contact Client Services before sending a specimen for testing of a time sensitive nature. We will ask for the following information: Facility name Account number Patient name and/or Cleveland Clinic Laboratories accession number Shipping information (i.e., courier service, FedEx®, etc.) Date to be sent Test ordered Facility name Account number Patient name and/or Cleveland Clinic Laboratories accession number Shipping information (i.e., courier service, FedEx®, etc.) Date to be sent Test ordered Place specimen in a separate Cleveland Clinic Laboratories temperature appropriate bag. Turnaround Time (TAT) At Cleveland Clinic our \"Patients First\" philosophy guides every aspect of patient care activities. Through our extensive test menu and commitment to the most rapid TAT possible, Cleveland Clinic Laboratories strives to carry out this commitment to excellent patient care. We define TAT as the analytical test time required. It is monitored closely and compared to standardized laboratory metrics for continuous quality improvement. For more information about TAT for specific tests, please refer to the Test Directory or contact Client Services.

Shipping containers, sterile specimen containers, transport media and swabs are available through Client Services. Specimen containers must be tightened securely to prevent leakage. Labeling Clearly print the patient’s complete name (as listed on the test request form) on the specimen container, culturette, or other specimen transport media. (Labeling of only the outside container is not acceptable). Transport Deliver specimens to the laboratory within 24 hours. Prompt processing minimizes loss in viability of potential pathogens and ensures a more accurate appraisal of flora present. Specimen Rejection Criteria for Microbiology Specimens Client Services will notify the ordering facility or healthcare provider of any test cancellations. Common causes for rejection of microbiology specimens are: Inappropriate specimen for culture requested Improper specimen container or transport media Inappropriate specimen for culture requested Improper specimen container or transport media General Microbiology Culture Types and Collection Instructions Blood The detection of microorganisms in blood has great diagnostic and prognostic importance. A completed test request form (particularly time of collection, diagnosis and antimicrobial therapy) is essential for timely and appropriate laboratory processing of the specimen. All routine blood cultures are screened for aerobic and anaerobic bacterial and fungal isolates. All organisms isolated from blood cultures will be identified, susceptibility tests performed, if appropriate, and stock cultures made, unless the isolate is considered a skin contaminant. Stock cultures will be held for 30 days. Organisms that may be contaminants are coagulase negative Staphylococcus species, Bacillus species, diphtheroid bacilli and viridans Streptococcus species. Blood cultures from patients suspected of having Brucella must be specifically requested as special cultures. (See the individual culture listings of the specific organisms for further details). Guidelines for Drawing Cultures In most adult infections, cultures of two to three separate venipunctures (20 30 mL per venipuncture) are sufficient. Studies have shown the following positive blood culture yields within a 24-hour period in patients without endocarditis: First venipuncture (Set): 80% First and second venipunctures (Set): 90% First, second and third venipunctures (Set): 99% Based on these results, the laboratory will not accept more than four blood culture sets per 24 hours per patient. In suspected acute sepsis, meningitis, osteomyelitis, arthritis or acute untreated bacterial pneumonia, obtain two blood culture sets (from two separate venipuncture sites) before starting therapy. For suspected infective endocarditis. Acute: Obtain three blood culture sets with three separate venipunctures during the first one to two hours of evaluation. Subacute: Obtain three blood culture sets on Day 1 (15 minutes or more apart). If all three are negative at 24 hours, obtain three more. A direct correlation exists between the volume of blood cultured and the recovery rate of clinically significant organisms. For adult patients, each blood culture bottle should receive 10mL of blood. Isolators should receive 10mL as indicated on the tube. For pediatric patients, one to five mL of blood injected into one aerobic blood culture bottle is sufficient. In most adult infections, cultures of two to three separate venipunctures (20 30 mL per venipuncture) are sufficient.

Specimen Collection After placing a tourniquet on the patient's arm, select a suitable vein. Once the vein has been found, cleanse the area with the series of 2% iodine, 70% alcohol, iodine and alcohol. Without touching the site of the venipuncture with the fingers, draw 20mL of blood into a sterile syringe. Inject 10mL of the specimen into each of two culture bottles after cleansing the stoppers with 2% iodine. Invert the containers several times to insure thorough mixture of the contents. (Blood culture systems are available through Client Services). For pediatric patients, write the volume of blood inoculated on the label. Blood cultures from patients suspected of having Histoplasma capsulatum, Brucella, Bartonella, Legionella or Mycobacterium must be specifically requested as special cultures and must be collected in a lysis centrifugation (Isolator™) tube.

(See the individual culture listings of the specific organisms for further details.) Bacterial Complete a Test Request Form indicating the specific source of the specimen, diagnosis and organism(s) suspected. Label the specimen appropriately. Record the date and time the specimen was collected. Urine Submit specimens in urine culture transport tubes provided by Cleveland Clinic Laboratories. Indicate whether the specimen is from a clean catch or a catheter. Collection Guidelines: Clean Catch Indwelling Catheter Specimen Collection Obtain the specimen with a needle and syringe. Select the puncture site 1 2 inches away from the catheter tube entry point. Cleanse the area to be punctured with 70% alcohol. Aspirate exactly 5mL of urine with a sterile needle and syringe. Disinfect the rubber stopper and aseptically transfer the specimen to the urine transport tube provided. Specimens obtained from the collection bag are not suitable for analysis. Foley tips will not be accepted. Urine Culture Transport Prevention of contamination by normal vaginal, perineal, and anterior urethral flora is the most important consideration for collection of a clinically relevant urine specimen. (See the Patient Collection Guidelines above for collection of a urine specimen). Unpreserved urine is an excellent growth medium for most bacteria. Unless urine is preserved during transport, bacteria may multiply, causing colony counts to be erroneously high. The maintenance medium in the transport kit prevents rapid multiplication of bacteria in the urine during shipment. Instructions for use of urine culture transport system: Obtain the urine specimen from the patient in a clean cup. Open the pouch and remove the transfer device and tube. Submerge the pipette of the transfer device to the bottom of the urine container. The container may be tipped at an angle if the volume of the urine is limited. Place the transport tube in the holder portion of the transfer device and push it down as far as it will go, puncturing the stopper. Hold the tube and transfer device in position until the urine stops flowing into the tube. Remove the transport tube from the transfer device and shake the tube vigorously. Discard the transfer device and remaining cup of urine into appropriate biohazard disposal containers. Obtain the urine specimen from the patient in a clean cup.

Discard the transfer device and remaining cup of urine into appropriate biohazard disposal containers. Precaution: The transport tube must be filled to the minimum line indicated on the tube. A tube that is not filled at least to this line is unacceptable for culture. Precaution: Respiratory The following collection sites are considered respiratory specimens: mouth, nose, nasopharyngeal swabs, throat sputum, bronchial and tracheal aspirations, bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and Bartlett Fiberoptic Wimberly (BFW) brush. All specimens from these sites will be screened for fast growing aerobic pathogenic organisms and for Beta Strep Group A. The following organisms are examples of those not isolated by routine culture: Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Corynebacterium diphtheriae and Bordetella species. Specimens from the nose are the only respiratory specimens routinely screened for Haemophilus species. For information on culture of non routine organisms, see the culture listing for the specific organism. Stool Refer to the Test Directory for collection information. Specimens must be submitted in transport media provided by the laboratory. Test Directory Miscellaneous Specimens from normally sterile sites (such as body fluids, surgical specimens, joint fluids, etc.) will be cultured for aerobic pathogenic organisms. Anaerobic pathogens may be detected by routine cultures. However, be aware of the special requirements for the isolation of anaerobes. If an anaerobic organism is suspected, a specimen should be submitted for anaerobic culture. Bone marrow, eye swabs, joint fluids and cerebrospinal fluids are routinely screened for fast growing aerobic pathogenic bacteria including Haemophilus species and pathogenic Neisseria species. Body fluids (exclusive of joint or cerebrospinal fluids) and surgical specimens will be routinely screened for fast-growing aerobic pathogens. Genital tract specimens are tested for Neisseria gonorrhoeae and/or Chlamydia trachomatis by amplification. If Haemophilus ducreyi is suspected, a special request must be made. In cases of suspected toxic shock syndrome, the tentative diagnosis should be placed on the requisition form so that isolates of Staphylococcus aureus may be saved for TSST-1 testing. Vaginal specimens must be accompanied by a request for examination for a specific organism (i.e. group B streptococci, Candida, Trichomonias vaginalis) or for gram stain, which may be examined for the presence of clue cells, curved bacteria, relative proportion of gram-positive bacilli resembling lactobacilli vs. Gram-negative bacilli. Culture for Gardnerella vaginalis is neither sensitive nor specific for the diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis and will not be done. Specimens from wounds, ulcers, and drainages will be screened for nonfastidious, fast-growing aerobic organisms. If an anaerobe is suspected, a specimen must be properly submitted and an anaerobic culture specifically ordered.

Nose or Nasopharyngeal Swabs Collect in a manner to avoid contamination by adjacent structures. Throat Specimens Collect in a manner to avoid contamination by mouth and tongue. Throat specimens will be screened for Group A Strep only. Throat specimens for Neisseria ganorrohoeae, Bordetella pertussis or Corynebacterium diphtheriae will be screened only for that pathogen when specifically requested. Collect in a manner to avoid contamination by mouth and tongue. Sputum Specimens Collect by instructing the patient to remove dentures, rinse mouth, gargle with water and cough deeply, expectorating into appropriate collection container. All specimens labeled \"sputum\" that are consistent on cytologic examination with saliva or upper respiratory secretions will be rejected. Rejection or acceptance will be based on microscopic examination for the absence of/or minimal numbers of squamous epithelial cells. Tracheal and Bronchial Aspiration Collect by physician to avoid contamination with adjacent structures. Fungus Provide complete information on the Test Request Form to ensure that the specimen is cultured for all organisms (fungi/yeast) suspected. Additional patient history may be helpful. Include the patient occupation, history of travel or residence abroad, and any animal contacts. A single specimen may be cultured for both bacteria and fungi. Generally, a direct fungal smear exam will be performed on all specimens submitted for fungal cultures. Yeast Requirements are the same as for a fungal culture. Urine, vaginal, throat and stool requests are routinely processed for a yeast culture, even if ordered as a fungal culture. Anaerobes Cultures for fastidious anaerobes will not be performed on urine (nonsuprapubic aspirate) or specimens from body sites that have anaerobes as part of the normal flora (stool, skin, vagina/cervix, mouth, throat, septum, etc.). Any material collected from areas with no normal flora (body fluids, deep abscess exudate, tissue biopsies, transtracheal aspirates, etc.) is acceptable for anaerobic culture. Specimens for anaerobic culture must be collected appropriately and transported in an anaerobic environment (anaerobe vial). Aspirated specimens, in general, are preferred. Swabs are unacceptable for anaerobe culture. Contact Client Services prior to collection of the specimen for consultation on collection procedures, containers, or transport. Client Services Acid Fast Bacillus All cultures and stains for AFB are performed at Cleveland Clinic. Acid fast stain results are generally available 24-48 hours from receipt of sample. Positive stains and/or culture results are called to the client. Transport specimens in sterile, leak-proof containers and place in appropriate shipping containers. Dry specimens or spilled-leaking specimens are not acceptable for AFB culture. Specimens submitted on swabs or sputums of low volume are discouraged for AFB culture because the yield is significantly decreased. Gastric contents must be neutralized with sodium carbonate or another alkaline buffer salt before transport. Respiratory specimens may be submitted for Mycobacterium tuberculosis amplification. Only specimens that are AFB stain positive are appropriate for testing. An AFB culture and smear should be ordered in conjunction with this request. This test is specific for, but does not differentiate between, members of the M. tuberculosis complex, i.e. M. tuberculosis, M. bovis BCG, M. africanum and M. micrati. A negative test does not exclude the possibility of isolating M. tuberculosis complex from the AFB culture.","id":"specimen-collection-handling-instructions"}}
